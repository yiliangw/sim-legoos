34 Years of Project Gutenberg


A Trillion eBooks Given Away !!!

If our average eBook has reached only 1% of the world population of
6,451,809,157 that would be 16,621 x 64,518,092 = 1.07 Trillion !!!


July 4, 2005 marks the completion of the 34th year of
Project Gutenberg and the beginning of our 35th year.


Here is a very brief review of our current projects:
[More information available on request]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


The original Distributed Proofreaders have now created
over 7,000 eBooks and you can volunteer to proofread 1
page or 100 pages or 1,000 at:     http://www.pgdp.net


At this moment the initial Project Gutenberg site has
progressed about 2/3 of the way from 10,000 to 20,000
cataloged items in a range of about 45 languages.

http://www.gutenberg.org

By July 4, 2006 this total should be at 20,000 items.


This total includes nearly 500 entries out of Project
Gutenberg of Australia.       http://gutenberg.net.au


104 languages are included with the Project Gutenberg
Consortia Center.             http://www.gutenberg.cc


In addition Project Gutenberg of Canada is beginning,

Project Gutenberg efforts are also starting to get on
track in Portugal and The Philippines.


We would like to take this opportunity to give thanks
to our major download site at ibiblio.org operated at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where
over a million eBooks per month have been downloaded,
month after month, year after year.


A year from now we hope you might be able to download
50,000 items via the combined Project Gutenberg sites.

*


  Not Just Downloads, We Also Hand Out Physical Media


In addition, we are working on The Million Dollar DVD
of which the current prototype contains nearly 26,000
eBooks, and is about 3/4 full.  With those additional
books we can add in the last 1/4, plus compression of
a better variety, we are hoping to put perhaps 40,000
eBooks on one single-sided single-layered DVD that we
can encourage people to copy onto $1 blanks.

Using about 1/3 of the current average hardback price
of ~$75, we can easily count these 40,000 eBooks with
the value as $1,000,000.

Of course, if you wanted to use "list price" then you
could say it was "The Three Million Dollar DVD" {TM}.

In addition, just a week ago we received our test DVD
for our first double-layered version, which would let
us put twice as much on a single disc, and now at the
same price per layer as the previous versions.  These
advances will likely continue until we are able to do
a double-sided double-layered DVD containing 155,000,
which means that you get a million dollar total value
using per book price less than the average paperback,
along with a searchable catalog.


Last week we gave away 10,000,000 eBooks in Alaska to
give a boost to the eBook program of Alaska's Library
Association, the University of Alaska, and many other
participants in our presentations there.

We donated a DVD containing 5,000 eBooks to every one
of the Alaska Library Association member libraries!!!

We are hoping to do such projects in North Dakota and
other far regions, as well as everywhere else we will
be asked.

Just let us know if you are interested.


These are some of the dreams of Project Gutenberg and
we would LOVE to include your goals in our projects.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has
received official non-profit 501(c)(3) status via the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and is solely supported
by your donations.  Nearly everyone at PG volunteers,
even those few who are on the payroll.

As always, our HUGE thanks to the tens of thousands of
people who have volunteered with Project Gutenberg and
to those who will carry us on into the future.


Michael S. Hart
Started July 4, 1971
Continuing July 4, 2005
2 Months To 1/3 Million eBooks


Urbana, Illinois.  May 4, 2006

1/3 Million eBooks Free from July 4 Through August 4

1/3 of a million books, or 10 times the number found
in the average public library, will be available for
free downloading via the Internet and World Wide Web
beginning July 4, as Project Gutenberg and the World
eBook Library act on their dreams of increased world
literacy and education.

Such a collection, if printed out in standard format
would be large enough to outweigh elephant herds and
to cover the sidelines at all 40 Super Bowl games.

Each year for one month, The World eBook Library and
Project Gutenberg will team up to be major sponsors,
planning to make ONE MILLION eBooks available in the
World eBook Fair of 2009.

"It has been our goal since the dawn of the Internet
to break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy,"
says Michael Hart, who founded the Project Gutenberg
effort by placing the first permanent text online on
July 4, 1971, 35 years ago.  "Our projects are based
on the premise that everyone in the world could have
access to a free worldwide public library," for John
Guagliardo, founder of The World eBook Library, this
event marks the fruition of years of hard labor.

Over 100 languages will be represented for worldwide
readers and that total is expected to increase, even
as the preparations are underway.  The books are the
permanent property of whomever downloads them, but a
warning is including to check your local copyrights,
as the books are provided under U.S. copyright laws,
and other nations have different copyrights.  eBooks
still under U.S. copyright have been donated via the
permission of the copyright holders.

Project Gutenberg, perhaps the oldest Internet site,
and The World eBook Library, perhaps the largest one
of the growing number of eBook libraries, joined for
the purpose of "bringing the most eBooks to the most
people in the world."

"This is the fulfillment of a lifetime of dreams," a
sentiment shared by Greg Newby, as Project Gutenberg
CEO, he hopes his Library & Information Science PhD.
will become the last of the olde library worlde, and
perhaps the first of a new world of library science.

"We can only hope that Google, Yahoo, and the others
can also achieve their goals in the next few years--
as we hope they will each reach for a million eBooks
before the decade ends.  Our own goals, with them or
without them, are to bring the world the 1/3 million
eBooks this year, 1/2 million next year, 3/4 million
in 2008, and to reach a grand total of a one million
volume World eBook Fair on July 4, 2009."

Additional facts and figures:


Proposed World eBook Fair totals for upcoming years:

July 4, 2006, 1/3 Million
July 4, 2007, 1/2 Million
July 4, 2008, 3/4 Million
July 4, 2009, ONE Million

*

By 2009, the terabyte [one thousand gigabytes] boxes
we have seen enter the consumer marketplace in 2006,
now priced as low as $500, will be commonplace on an
average computer on the shelf and will easily hold a
million volumes of a million characters each for the
price of just one semester's books at a university.

*

Project Gutenberg and The World eBook Library are an
example of the 501 (c) (3) corporations that operate
on a non-profit basis to improve the world.

*

Project Gutenberg eBooks are all free of charge from
http://www.gutenberg.org or http://gutenberg.net.au,
the home of Project Gutenberg of Australia, and also
http://pge.rastko.net, Project Gutenberg of Europe.

In addition The World eBook Library sponsors Project
Gutenberg's Consortia Center where entire collection
providers around the world make many eBook libraries
available in their entirety. http://www.gutenberg.cc

The World eBook Library, a member supported service,
offers unrestricted access to its collection of over
250,000 eBooks, documents, and articles.  Individual
membership is only $8.95 a year, discounted to $1 on
a per student or FTE [full time equivalency] for the
various educational groups or institutions.  An even
greater discount is available for public libraries.

For those who cannot afford a membership, or who may
be experiencing hardships, these World eBook Library
services are provided via complimentary subscription
services via Natural Disaster Relief Programs and/or
Economic Hardship Relief Subscriptions.  Not one who
has ever qualified for complimentary subscription of
either of these programs has ever been denied.

The World eBook Fair effort at worldebookfair.com or
via www.gutenberg.org is a cooperative effort by the
World eBook Library Consortia and Project Gutenberg,
representing the largest and oldest eBook libraries.

1/3 of a million eBooks will be made available for a
period from July 4 to August 4 this year in honor of
the date of the first steps taken to make eLibraries
on July 4, 1971, on what was to become the Internet,
via what as to become Project Gutenberg.

This celebration is to promote book awareness and to
assist in efforts to increase literacy and education
all over the world.

We hope you enjoy some of your favorite books in the
editions presented here and that you will pass those
on to others we hope will enjoy them as much as you.

Please feel free to send in requests for books to be
included in future World eBook Fairs.

*

We hope you will see fit to give this press release,
and future similar releases, your consideration, and
that you will see fit to pass them on to others.

If you have any favorite media people, encouragement
to them to use this would be wonderful!


Thank you so much!

Michael S. Hart

CHAPTER III

MIDDLETON'S RESOLVE


"I shall go down to Wokingham", said Middleton, "a few days 
before the election, and the Major will stay here. I 
understand that there will be no other candidate, and _I_
shall take the seat.

"The Major is a . . . _flaneur_. He has no interest beyond 
his own advancement. I can buy him for a hundred pounds. 
_Here_ is his answer."

Wallace wondered at the _hubris_ of his friend, and 
examined the note Middleton thrust upon him.

"Sir,
    No consideration would induce me to
change my resolve in this matter, but I am
willing to engage your services as my agent
for a fee of 100 pounds.
                     H. Middleton"



CHAPTER IV

THE ELECTION

  Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
      Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
                                    ---- BYRON

On hearing of Middleton's visit, Mr. Wentworth began his 
preparations. Meeting with Thomas Lake and Riley at the 
back of the tap-room of The Bull & Gate--where the landlord
saw to it that they remained undisturbed--he laid out their
plan of campaign.

"That d---l Middleton shall not have the seat," he raved,
"not for Lord H------; no, nor for a hundred Lords! We 
shall see to it that every man's hand is turned against
him when he arrives."

Lake unfolded a paper from his vest-pocket and smoothed it
on the table. "Here are the expenses we should undertake."

PG NEEDS YOU! NOVEMBER 1996

PG NEEDS YOUR HELP MORE THAN EVER

Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

I have never been good at asking for help, but we need the help more than
ever before as you will see if you read on.

We need to get incorporated. [Therefore we need lawyers.]

25 years ago Project Gutenberg started putting information on the Internet,
years earlier than any other providers of general information, at a time
when the only people on the Internet/ARPANet were paid professionals.

[Today their continued presence on the Net is threatened.]

At that time only the geekiest of the geeks understood any of the messages
posted in the Net, and Project Gutenberg's unpaid volunteers, the first Plain
Vanilla Netizens, would change the face of the Internet forever with postings
that everyone could read and understand, for decades to come.

[And we would very much hope to continue, with your help.]

Next week Project Gutenberg plans to release #700 in their series, and at
the moment of this writing #696 has already made its way around the world;
by the time you are reading this, it is likely that #700 will already be
posted, as we are a few days ahead of schedule.

[And in only four more months we hope to be posting #1000]

While Project Gutenberg has managed to roll out book after book on schedule.
. .official release date is midnight the last day of each month. . .on time
and "under budget". . .

[From our earliest files that were limited to about 5K, to some of our most
recent files that are 45M of text, nearly 10,000 times as large as our original
files.]

BUT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !

the fact is that this is not likely to be able to continue without your support
because the support we used to get is changing for the worse as the old
information pathways our work created have become paved, re-paved, and finally
they have become marked with those signs that say NO PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC,
NO MOTOR DRIVEN CYCLES, NO FARM IMPLEMENTS and no anything else other than
high-cost, high-maintenance, cost ineffective behemoths in full motion video,
stereophonics, and point and click interfaces.

Let's face it. . .books on computers do not require higher technology than
was available fifteen years ago. . .unless you are searching large books.
. .but for just reading and writing books, the oldest, slowest PC is just
fine.

This kind of traffic is the most efficient for information transmission,
far more efficient than movies or markup, in that it not only reaches a wider
audience but that it also takes much less storage and bandwidth.

While Project Gutenberg has been a leader in developing an Internet philosophy
that benefits all the fact is that the "bells and whistles" of the cutest
new Internet things are getting all the money and attention, but they are
not very effective in creating a new generation of people who would be considered
free of ignorance and illiteracy. We need a bit of that money and attention,
and we think of no better possible investment than in placing the great books
of the civilizations of the world into the hands of everyone, for the rest
of history. PLEASE HELP US HELP THE WORLD!

However, all the new "bells and whistles" and repaving the Information
Superhighway in ways that eliminate all but an entirely "new order" of
information providers: commercial in nature, or, perhaps even worse,
non-commercial sites in direct imitation of the commercial sites.

The new proposals for Internet traffic are supposed to put books and other
text on the sidings, while express trains, full of Hollywood imagery, flash
by while the script words just lie there and wait.


I am afraid the situation is much worse that I am willing, it takes more
courage than _I_ have, to describe in detail that I have had to live with
every day for half a year.

Here is part of it:

Problem #1

1. As many of you have heard, the University of Illinois, where Project Gutenberg
was founded in 1971, has decided a continued support of Project Gutenberg
is not in line with a new stiff political policy, to keep out all unauthorized
users, and as part of this policy to eliminate that access Project Gutenberg
has had, authorized but unofficial.

Just part of the new paving process. . .sorry. . .but your access has become
just another roadkill in our efforts for the creation of a mirror-surfaced
Information Superhighway whose mirror will now only reflect authorized
information.

Problem #2

2. What you have not heard is that due to tough financial situations, that
Illinois Benedictine College, [now called Benedictine University] which is
our "official sponsor" is no longer able to provide even the minimal financial
which kept us going through the period when Project Gutenberg in essence
became a full-time job.

Problem #3

3. In addition, our third major means of support, a CDROM made by Walnut
Creek, has had several problems, including, but not limited to, change of
high-level personnel, CDROMs reportedly selling less this year for the first
time, with accounting problems on top of that.

1-2-3. . .just like that, all three of our major supports, cut drastically,
for most of the past year. . .and we have still kept producing Project Gutenberg
Etexts on schedule.

Solution #0

0. The fourth leg of support for Project Gutenberg is, as always, you, the
people. When I started Project Gutenberg, I obeyed that law "Never Quit Your
Day Job for Shareware". . .a law that was not in existence at that time.
. .but as time passed, doubling in output every year took more and more of
my time, I was not able to continue to work as a consultant AND Gutenberg
all at the same time, and Project Gutenberg was too important, is too important,
to let go of. It is VERY hard to stop-- when I think of the fact that if
I can just hold on 1 more year. . .we can multiply our total productivity
by 2.

However, the truth is, that even without my going out from task of actually
getting the books on line to go shmoozing to get support from corporate sources,
even with a request to you for donations in every book we post, the truth
is-- that most of our donations have come from corporations.

A wonderful thing. . .when you think about it. . .but none the less, not
something we can depend on for the future as we never know when these are
going to happen.

If anyone reading this is the sort of person who is happy, even just satisfied,
working with grants, requests, etc, I would welcome your help extremely
gratefully, as I am not, at least never have been, the kind of person who
will stop working on something to get support for that work.

I feel that if the work is really worthwhile and _I_ think Project Gutenberg
is the MOST WORTHWHILE activity I can do . . .then the work itself will create
the needed support-- if not, perhaps I am suffering under delusions.

However, even at that, recent events have conspired to set my mind on getting
Project Gutenberg incorporated, and you are invited to help as much as you
can. These events have shown that it is possible for three independent structures
of seemingly permanent support to all fail simultaneously.

I would very much like to see Project Gutenberg survive to continue after
I am gone, but I realize now that it is not likely that I will be able to
find someone to take over in the same function I have had, which I define
as merely the hub of the wheel, so I have to consider institutionalizing
something that has always been just the raggedy collection of interested
parties, something that could not be without the Internet, and perhaps something
that should never have been able to come into existence at any other time
than it did. . .especially if they continue running over us with a continually
New and Improved Superhighway Steamroller.

So. . .after all that. . .what do we need:

Solution #1

1. We need to get incorporated, hopefully non-profit. This will finally allow
us control over our own finances-- right now the Benedictine University is
in its first years under a new accounting system which has no way to take
any account of something like Project Gutenberg, even though a very expensive
review of the University began with a first line of: "Project Gutenberg is
the only thing you can NOT afford to lose."

Such are the perils of large organizations.

We need to be able to pay our bills in ways that are not a maze of paperwork
so intense that I mostly decide to pay a bill myself rather than do the
paperwork. If Gutenberg is a survivor, I will be repaid. . .if not. . .then
it cannot really matter.

Solution #2

2. We need to gain some kind of financial base. For most of the 25 years
of Project Gutenberg I have paid, usually not terribly large amounts, for
all the expenses-- though in 1989 things really took off and not only did
the expenses go up but I also started spending so much time on the project
that I didn't have much time for much else.

However, two things happened then that allowed me to set a pathway that proved
fairly secure. One was that my father died, and left me just enough money
to either pay off that nasty mortgage on my house, or to invest enough in
Project Gutenberg to keep it running for the foreseeable future.

The other thing was that Illinois Benedictine College, now Benedictine
University, took a great interest in person of their new Vice President,
Bob Preston. However, he is now President of a different college.

Therefore, if you have any abilities at all in the dealing with large
corporations and foundations we would certainly appreciate your help, or
even if you just want to learn to do such things. I, myself, am merely the
kind of person a world would think of as a workaholic with an idea that may
be able to change the world for the better, I am not in an even remotely
true sense any kind of salesman or shmoozer.

I just like doing the work and seeing it do more work.

We have seen a BILLION dollars earmarked for an Electronic Library. . .from
all the major foundations. . .yet when it comes to talking to them about
it. . ._I_ find myself in a drowning in barnyard material when I approach
them. Help!

Solution #3

Anything possible to keep us alive and functioning.

I had planned to leave my house to Project Gutenberg, as I have just barely
managed to finish paying it off, but I am perhaps forced to consider once
again doing the mortgage-- though when I realize how much I could have saved
it I had paid it off back in 1989. . .

If you have any ideas, suggestions, places to try, we hope you will contact
anyone you know on our behalf, you are as much part of Project Gutenberg
as anyone. . . !

I have considered just publishing a list of foundations we think should be
interested in Project Gutenberg and having you write letters directly to
them, in addition to whoever might do any independent contacting.

Conclusion

While it doesn't take much money to keep Project Gutenberg running, probably
only $2,000 per month, you might be very surprised that the over 5,000 newsletter
subscribers might send in an average of only one cent per month each. These
contributions are gratefully accepted, and all are send an email or snailmail
thank you, but they only add up to less than $50 per month. The Benedictines
used to pay for half of our expenses, but they can't afford it any longer.
The several dozen commercial providers who sell access to text files we create,
either online or via disks, don't send us a cent, other than the Walnut Creek
CDROM company, but the situation there is not something we can rely on to
keep us going on more than a day to day basis, as sales are down.

While it is not quite time to PANIC!. . .it is getting all too close. . .and
I certainly would not expect a volunteer army to pop out of the woodwork
on a moment's notice, so I am sending this out a month or two before my
prediction of when it will be time to panic.

I am pretty sure I can last until the holidays, but I will certainly ask
you all to put us on your holiday gift list.

In addition to all of the above, we also plan to keep up a policy of doubling
our production every year, and thus for two books per day during 1997. As
long as we survive, the work should continue to get done on schedule, providing
we double the number of Project Gutenberg Volunteers, too.

It is amazing when I look back on it, but a year ago, from right now, we
were just posting

Etext #350. . .

and now we are posting #700. . . .

If it weren't for the facts that we are in so very serious trouble in our
support structure, we should celebrate in a great fashion that we have once
again managed not only the survival of another year but the creation and
distribution of as many Etexts in the past year as we managed to get on line
in the 24 years before that.

Hopefully next year we will get to celebrate Etext #1,000, in a slightly
less reserved tone.

For now, you can help us in several ways:

1. Get financial donations sent to "Project Gutenberg/BU" at POBox 2782,
Champaign, IL, 61825-2782.

2. Volunteer to help create new Etexts by subscribing for this as follows:

email to listproc@prairienet.org

[no subject required, the only content needs to be]

subscribe gutnberg [firstname lastname]

subscribe gutvol-l [firstname lastname]

If you don't want to volunteer, just subscribe to gutnberg and don't subscribe
to gutvol-l.

Please also send a copy [cc:] to hart@pobox.com, and I can make sure your
subscriptions go through.

If you want make sure you are also on our old listservers, you can also send
the above email to:

listserv@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu

Once again I thank all of the 700 volunteers who have been responsible for
the creation of the 350 new Etext sent out to the world last year, and I
will hopefully be thanking a group of 700 more volunteers over the next year,
as it may still take us an average of two volunteers to create every book
we manage to complete. We would also love to do more books in other languages!!!

Wishing you all the best,

Michael S. Hart

[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

[We only send such messages in once each April and October.]

[*Now that we can soon officially say we have "thousands" of
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more later]

The Project Gutenberg Request for Support for April 23, 1999

Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net.pg!!
[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers, we are ALL volunteers]

*

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 2,000 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$5 as the "street value" of the average one of our books, as
the population is passing 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.

*

Today is:

The 383rd anniversary of the death of Cervantes, author of
our 2,000th Etext, Don Quixote. . .and also the birthday &
death day of Shakespeare.  They died the same day in 1616.
Shakespeare was born April 23, 1564, 435 years ago, today.
This date has also just recently become known as the World
Book Day [www.gencat.es/bookday/index.htm]. . . .

We are sending this out to you an extra day early due to any
listserver relaying delay of day or so.  We hope you receive
this in a timely manner.]  It also contains some updates for
our index file, including the Etexts for July, 1999. . . .

*

In addition to honoring the author of our Etext #2000. . . .
This is sent in honor of World Book Day and National Library
Library Week in the U.S., and various other means to promote
books, reading, and literacy; please take part in any way in
these efforts.

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001.

The 2000th Project Gutenberg Etext should be posted by now!!

and we have a new site to post it on:

ftp://ftp.knowledge.com/pub/mirrors/gutenberg/

New Etexts Needing Proofreading

Followed By More Detailed Information On Most Of These Subjects


***


1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.


Most of our donations are simply mailed to:

Project Gutenberg
P. O. Box  2782
Champaign, IL 61825-2782

and are made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU"

Carnegie Mellon University has also graciously provided those means
necessary for credit card and other means of donation.  Just let us
know, and we will put you in touch with the right people there.

The Holiday Season of 1996 was the first time we ever raised enough
in a month to support Project Gutenberg for that month, but we have
received only a few donations since that time.  I would like to see
Project Gutenberg become more or less an independent grassroot type
of organization, but I am not really much of a fund-raiser type, as
the fund-raiser at Carnegie Mellon University can tell you.

Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 2,000th Etext.  This should not be too difficult in
one respect, as many of the sites on the World Wide Web have never,
not once, been updated, since 1995.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 432 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 500 year after #2000, which is schedule for January 1, 2000.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.

Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

[This has happened since our last message of this kind] and will be
happening in most other countries unless action is taken.  Lawsuits
are being made to reverse this trend, but not much chance without a
lot of public relations efforts]

Rumor has it that the United States is pushing through HR604 & S505
[House Resolution #604 and Senate Bill #505] which comprise what is
called "The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998" which will remove
20 years of what would be Public Domain information from our future
libraries.  We strongly suggest you call AND write your congressmen
to avoid removing a million books from what is already becoming the
"Information Rich Versus Information Poor" in a nations in which an
illiteracy rate is virtually equal to the literacy rate, in adults,
aged 16 and over, as per the 1994 US Literacy Report.

You can subscribe to a listserver on copyright extension at:
extension-l@olemiss.edu

or go to web sites on the subject at:

http://davinci.marc.gatech.edu/~tad/dennis/no-cense.htm



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of Carnegie Mellon University and people
I would hope to count as my friends are the backbone of our support
and we could hardly survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

Project Gutenberg Request for Support for November 17, 1999.


[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

[We only send such messages once each Spring and/or Autumn.]

Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers, we are ALL volunteers]

***

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 2,000 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$5 as the "street value" of the average one of our books, as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.  In fact, we are half the way
from using the $5 nominal value to the $4 value that will be
the result of our posting Etext #2500. . .but then it may be
a while to get to the $3 mark at Etext #3333, as it takes an
ever increasing number to bring the cost down another dollar
. . .this time it will take 833 more Etexts. . .last time it
only took 500 more. . .next time it will take 1666 to get it
from $3 to $2. . .and then 5000 more to get nominal price of
a book down to $1 and still give away $1 trillion in Etexts.

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001. . .

This is a goal we may have already accomplished, though many
of the 10,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are working to get them posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are dicsussing this a
lot with the other Etext makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the Etexts makers is one of our major goals right now.

The 2350th Project Gutenberg Etext should be posted shortly!
And we should have created 1/3 of the 10,000 we hope to have
posted by the end of 2001, and hopefully encouraged donation
of the other 2/3 by the other Etext non-commerical efforts.

Before we even get to the Table of Contents, here are a few requests
for help directly from our volunteers:

Help with UMAX scanner for Win95 or 98 for Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>

For any persons interested in working on the works of Sir Richard F.
Burton, we're trying to put together a Burton Team.  The first objective
is to prepare the Arabian Nights for publication.  Other works will be
forthcoming.  If you are interested in participating on the team, please
contact me at jcbyers@netscape.com.  The complete Table of Contents of
the Arabian Nights is available at

and choose a 'Tale' to work on.  jcbyers <jcbyers@netscape.net>

If we are going to continue on past our first goal of 10,000 Etexts,
we are going to need some Big Time public relations help, and some
Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the Etexts to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many Etexts. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for Etexts for years and just at
that present time FINALLY FOUND US. . . .  That means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in the November 8th edition
of TIME magazine, but we have received less than a dozen emails per
that article. . .what we really need to do is get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us. . . !

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

2.  Running group of 1,000 volunteers to generate 10,000 Etexts has
been something that IS a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do it. . .otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .but running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 Etext that are possible in the NEXT 10 years, is NOT easy
. . .even for someone such as myself. . .it will require more phone
lines and calls than I can afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own, so we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or, the
possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

Etexts in Various Languages

As you may be aware, this last year we have greatly expanded our
output of Etexts in languages other than English, including:

1.  French
2.  German
3.  Spanish
4.  Italian
5.  Danish
6.  Swedish
7.  Chinese
8.  Japanese
9.  Latin

and more. . .and we would like to continue doing more Etexts in
these language and even more languages.  So. . .if you have the
skills to work in languages other than English, or to manage an
Etext Team in any language, English included please let me know!!!


Here is a request from our Spanish Team Leader:


From:  Jesus Joglar" <joglar@iiqab.csic.es> our Spanish Team Leader

[He is very busy, so we could use more Spanish Team Leaders if any
of you are willing. . . .]


Besides I think that we did not get as much enthusiasm as expected from the
potential volunteers, but anyway I will keep going at my own pace. In this
context I would like to tell you that I have a file of a book written by
Francisco de Quevedo called "El buscsn" (a classic from the spanish golden
age) ready to get proofed. Is it possible to ask for help with this one?

I also have the book (46 files for the moment) of poems by a cuban writer
(Josi Martm: Versos Sencillos [Maybe you know it because it was sung by
people like Pete Seeger or Joan Baez]) and another spanish classic (Amadms
de Gaula written by Garci Rodrmguez de Montalvo. This is in 138 files and
it is a kind of Don Quijote with regard to the date and type).

I will go working on these and letting you know about my progress. As soon
as I have a little bit more of time I will contact some of the "old"
volunteers to try to forward a little the spanish etexts group unless
someone else would do it.


1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.


Most of our donations are simply mailed to:

Project Gutenberg
P. O. Box  2782
Champaign, IL 61825-2782

and are made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU"

Carnegie Mellon University has also graciously provided those means
necessary for credit card and other means of donation.  Just let us
know, and we will put you in touch with the right people there.

The Holiday Season of 1996 was the first time we ever raised enough
in a month to support Project Gutenberg for that month, but we have
received only a few donations since that time.  I would like to see
Project Gutenberg become more or less an independent grassroot type
of organization, but I am not really much of a fund-raiser type, as
the fund-raiser at Carnegie Mellon University can tell you.

Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 2,000th Etext.  This should not be too difficult in
one respect, as many of the sites on the World Wide Web have never,
not once, been updated, since 1995.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 432 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 500 year after #2000, which is schedule for January 1, 2000.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

[This has happened since our last message of this kind] and will be
happening in most other countries unless action is taken.  Lawsuits
are being made to reverse this trend, but not much chance without a
lot of public relations efforts]

Rumor has it that the United States is pushing through HR604 & S505
[House Resolution #604 and Senate Bill #505] which comprise what is
called "The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998" which will remove
20 years of what would be Public Domain information from our future
libraries.  We strongly suggest you call AND write your congressmen
to avoid removing a million books from what is already becoming the
"Information Rich Versus Information Poor" in a nations in which an
illiteracy rate is virtually equal to the literacy rate, in adults,
aged 16 and over, as per the 1994 US Literacy Report.

2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of Carnegie Mellon University and people
I would hope to count as my friends are the backbone of our support
and we could hardly survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

INTERNET USERS NOW EXCEED 100 MILLION
Over 100 million adults in the U.S., or half the country's adult
population, now use the Internet, according to a Strategis Group
report released this week.  In mid 1998, the report showed that
65 million U.S. adults were using the Internet.  Internet users
are becoming more sophisticated in their use of the medium, with
77 percent of users sending e-mail with files or attachments every
week, the report says.  Users send an average of six e-mails a
day, and over 20 percent of users have built or updated a Web
page in the past three months.  The number of U.S. Internet users
is projected to reach 177 million by the end of 2003, according
to International Data.  Globally, the number of Internet users
will reach 502 million by 2003, compared with 142 million in
1998, IDC says.  (New York Times 11/12/99)

!!!Project Gutenberg Request for Support for March 8, 2000!!

Birthday of the Michael  Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg!


[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

[We only send such messages once each Spring and/or Autumn.]

Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers, we are ALL volunteers]

***

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 2,500 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$5 as the "street value" of the average one of our books, as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.  In fact, we are ~all the way
from using the $5 nominal value to the $4 value that will be
the result of our posting Etext #2500. . .but then it may be
a while to get to the $3 mark at Etext #3333, as it takes an
ever increasing number to bring the cost down another dollar
. . .this time it will take 833 more Etexts. . .last time it
only took 500 more. . .next time it will take 1666 to get it
from $3 to $2. . .and then 5000 more to get nominal price of
a book down to $1 and still give away $1 trillion in Etexts.

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001. . .

This is a goal we may have already accomplished, though many
of the 10,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are working to get them posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are dicsussing this a
lot with the other Etext makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the Etexts makers is one of our major goals right now.

The 2350th Project Gutenberg Etext should be posted shortly!
And we should have created 1/3 of the 10,000 we hope to have
posted by the end of 2001, and hopefully encouraged donation
of the other 2/3 by the other Etext non-commerical efforts.

***

Before we even get to the Table of Contents, here are a few requests
for help directly from our volunteers:

We need help getting a new translation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas
out of WordPerfect 6.1 and into plain text, with some indication of the
breaks between paragraphs.  Please email hart@pobox.com.  Thanks!  mh

For any persons interested in working on the works of Sir Richard F.
Burton, we're trying to put together a Burton Team.  The first objective
is to prepare the Arabian Nights for publication.  Other works will be
forthcoming.  If you are interested in participating on the team, please
contact me at jcbyers@netscape.com.  The complete Table of Contents of
the Arabian Nights is available at
www.capitalnet.com/~jcbyers/default.htm.  Feel free to peruse the site
and choose a 'Tale' to work on.  jcbyers <jcbyers@netscape.net>

If we are going to continue on past our first goal of 10,000 Etexts,
we are going to need some Big Time public relations help, and some
Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the Etexts to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many Etexts. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for Etexts for years and just at
that present time FINALLY FOUND US. . . .  That means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in the November 8th edition
of TIME magazine, but we have received less than a dozen emails per
that article. . .what we really need to do is get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us. . . !

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

2.  Running group of 1,000 volunteers to generate 10,000 Etexts has
been something that IS a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do it. . .otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .but running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 Etext that are possible in the NEXT 10 years, is NOT easy
. . .even for someone such as myself. . .it will require more phone
lines and calls than I can afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own, so we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or, the
possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

Etexts in Various Languages

As you may be aware, this last year we have greatly expanded our
output of Etexts in languages other than English, including:

1.  French
2.  German
3.  Spanish
4.  Italian
5.  Danish
6.  Swedish
7.  Chinese
8.  Japanese
9.  Latin

and more. . .and we would like to continue doing more Etexts in
these language and even more languages.  So. . .if you have the
skills to work in languages other than English, or to manage an
Etext Team in any language, English included please let me know!!!


Here is a request from our Spanish Team Leader:


From:  Jesus Joglar" <joglar@iiqab.csic.es> our Spanish Team Leader

[He is very busy, so we could use more Spanish Team Leaders if any
of you are willing. . . .]


Besides I think that we did not get as much enthusiasm as expected from the
potential volunteers, but anyway I will keep going at my own pace. In this
context I would like to tell you that I have a file of a book written by
Francisco de Quevedo called "El buscsn" (a classic from the spanish golden
age) ready to get proofed. Is it possible to ask for help with this one?

I also have the book (46 files for the moment) of poems by a cuban writer
(Josi Martm: Versos Sencillos [Maybe you know it because it was sung by
people like Pete Seeger or Joan Baez]) and another spanish classic (Amadms
de Gaula written by Garci Rodrmguez de Montalvo. This is in 138 files and
it is a kind of Don Quijote with regard to the date and type).

I will go working on these and letting you know about my progress. As soon
as I have a little bit more of time I will contact some of the "old"
volunteers to try to forward a little the spanish etexts group unless
someone else would do it.


1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.


Most of our donations are simply mailed to:

Project Gutenberg
P. O. Box  2782
Champaign, IL 61825-2782

and are made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU"

Carnegie Mellon University has also graciously provided those means
necessary for credit card and other means of donation.  Just let us
know, and we will put you in touch with the right people there.

The Holiday Season of 1996 was the first time we ever raised enough
in a month to support Project Gutenberg for that month, but we have
received only a few donations since that time.  I would like to see
Project Gutenberg become more or less an independent grassroot type
of organization, but I am not really much of a fund-raiser type, as
the fund-raiser at Carnegie Mellon University can tell you.

Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 2,000th Etext.  This should not be too difficult in
one respect, as many of the sites on the World Wide Web have never,
not once, been updated, since 1995.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 432 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 500 year after #2000, which is schedule for January 1, 2000.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

[This has happened since our last message of this kind] and will be
happening in most other countries unless action is taken.  Lawsuits
are being made to reverse this trend, but not much chance without a
lot of public relations efforts]

Rumor has it that the United States is pushing through HR604 & S505
[House Resolution #604 and Senate Bill #505] which comprise what is
called "The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998" which will remove
20 years of what would be Public Domain information from our future
libraries.  We strongly suggest you call AND write your congressmen
to avoid removing a million books from what is already becoming the
"Information Rich Versus Information Poor" in a nations in which an
illiteracy rate is virtually equal to the literacy rate, in adults,
aged 16 and over, as per the 1994 US Literacy Report.

You can subscribe to a listserver on copyright extension at:
extension-l@olemiss.edu

or go to web sites on the subject at:
http://www.public.asu.edu/~dkarjala/
http://davinci.marc.gatech.edu/~tad/dennis/no-cense.htm



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of Carnegie Mellon University and people
I would hope to count as my friends are the backbone of our support
and we could hardly survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

*

And now here are the listings of our most recent Etexts, an extra month, just
for those of you who have read this far. . .we hope you enjoy them. . . .

Actually, I ended up putting them in a separate message this year. . . .
Please see extra Newsletter accompanying this.

Hopefully it has been worth your while to read this far. . .and you will take
a moment to consider making a tax-deductible donation to Project Gutenberg as
we are, as once before, without any financial income, including myself. . .mh


Project Gutenberg donations are tax deductible to the full extents
of the law, and are handled by Carnegie Mellon University.  If you
need a letter verifying your contribution, please mention that.

       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html




*Announcing Project Gutenberg Etext #3000, Proust in French*
************************************************************


Why Should *YOU* Support Project Gutenberg?

Because The Work of Project Gutenberg is:

1.  Permanent
2.  Free
3.  Available
4.  Useful
5.  Enlightening
6.  Growing

and, best of all

7.  Yours!


First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .and we are now supported by a Trust/
Foundation which will hopefully help continue the existence of PG
for more decades, or even centuries into the future.


2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our Etexts.


3.  Available

There are mirror sites wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last month or two, new
sites have been announced in Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary.
Contrary to the policies of most Etext operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our Etexts and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
Etexts to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg Etexts are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg Etexts in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classis books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language every month or two in 2001, please made sure
we have something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing

Project Gutenberg is now producing 50 Etexts/month, 600/year. . .
It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year,
and in a few years, with your support, we hope to do 1,000 Etexts
in a calendar year.

We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy whole
new bookshelves each and every month to hold them all the paper
editions we present. . .or just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg Etext, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of the that are copyrighted works.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .any time you
want. . .any place you want. . .and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now it it's 30th year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  It is
not like a museum or library, you won't come for a visit and NOT see
your effect right there for everyone to see and have. . . .

You won't find PBS showing all their shows from 30 years ago. . .
but the Project Gutenberg Etexts are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads Alice in Wonderland now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . . .

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
Etexts being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most Etexts you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that that will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg Etext
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with mininal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these Etexts ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg Etext. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these Etexts just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

Thousands of Project Gutenberg Etexts are available, and no one is ever
charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the Etexts are done
by volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg Etexts are available from servers on all continents.
We are continually expanding the number of servers, and evenutally hope to
have servers not just on every continent, but in every region, and then in
every country.  We are now working on sites in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read Etexts and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
Etexts on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our Etexts on disk years before the Internet
actually circled the globe.

Our Etexts are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete

editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our Etexts available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of Etexts.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make Etext available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with their
own favorite search engines, and to copy anywhere, any time.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Englightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing

We are officially producing 50 Etexts per month at this time,
and unofficially we are producing even more.  Last year we averaged
about 75 per month for the second half of the year, and we are doing
the same this year.  At this rate, we will soon cross the boundary
of 1,000 Etexts produced in a single year.

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 30th year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

We should reach approximately 3,000 Etexts by the official end of 2001,
but since we are about a year ahead of schedule, this will likely take
place in the next few months.  [hee hee, when I started writing this a
month ago, I had no idea I might be announcing #3000 in THIS message!!!]

Here is how we got there:

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed our first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

From 1980-1990 we completed our first Bible and Shakepeare,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus our total was 10 Etexts.
[We counted Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]

 1 per month in 1991
 2 per month in 1992
 4 per month in 1993
 8 per month in 1994 We reached a total of 100 Etexts
16 per month in 1995
32 per month in 1996
32 per month in 1997 We reached a total of 1,000 Etexts
36 per month in 1998
36 per month in 1999 We reached a total of 2,000 Etexts
36 per month in 2000
40 per month in 2001 for the first half of the year
then
50 per month in 2001 for the second half of the year

We will end the "Official Year of 2001" with 3,000 Etexts!!!


[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 3,000 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$3.33 as a street value of the average one of our books:  as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.  In fact, we are ~all the way
from using the $5 nominal value, thru the $4 value, that was
the result of our posting Etext #2500. . .but then it may be
a while to get to the $3 mark at Etext #3333, as it takes an
ever increasing number to bring the cost down another dollar
. . .this time it will take 833 more Etexts. . .last time it
only took 500 more. . .next time it will take 1666 to get it
from $3 to $2. . .and then 5000 more to get nominal price of
a book down to $1 and still give away $1 trillion in Etexts.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001. . .

This is a goal we may have already accomplished, though many
of the 10,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are working to get them posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are dicsussing this a
lot with the other Etext makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the Etexts makers is one of our major goals right now.

***

If we are going to continue on past our first goal of 10,000 Etexts,
we are going to need some Big Time public relations help, and some
Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the Etexts to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many Etexts. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for Etexts for years and just at
that present time FINALLY FOUND US. . . .  That means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in the November 8th edition
of TIME magazine, but we have received less than a dozen emails per
that article. . .what we really need to do is get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us. . . !

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

2.  Running group of 1,500 volunteers to generate 10,000 Etexts has
been something that IS a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do it. . .otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .but running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 Etext that are possible in the NEXT 10 years, is NOT easy
. . .even for someone such as myself. . .it will require more phone
lines and calls than I can afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own, so we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or, the
possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

Etexts in Various Languages

As you may be aware, this last year we have greatly expanded our
output of Etexts in languages other than English, including:


1.  English
2.  Latin
3.  French
4.  Italian
5.  German
6.  Spanish
7.  Chinese
8.  Japanese
9.  Swedish
10. Danish
11. DNA/ATGC
12. Welsh
13. Portuguese
14. Welsh
15. Bulgarian
16. Dutch/Flemish
17. Greek*
18. Hebrew*
19. Old French*
20. Polish*
21  Russian*
22. Romanian*
[Those with an * are still in need of work]



1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota,
Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont. As the requirements for other states
are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will
begin in the additional states. These donations should be made to
the "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation" and mailed to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109


Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 3,000th Etext.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 600 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 1,000 year after 2002.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>


8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

1.
Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but are being prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of people I would hope to count as my
friends are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives  [This needs a rewrite]

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

***Project Gutenberg Request for Support for May 16, 2001***

[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

[We only send such messages once each Spring and/or Autumn.]
[We put this off from April 15, so we could include several
new state registrations and further information on the rest]

Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.

       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


   We Have Made It Much Easier To Donate [More Below]



Right now we are in a sort of "Catch-22" situation with
fundraising right now. . .we are registered in about 1/3
of the states right now, with paperwork in to get to 2/3,
but we don't have enough money to register in the last 1/3,
and the first 1/3 will start needing to be renewed by the
time we get to the last 1/3. . .and the stack of paperwork
for these is literally as large as the person handling them.

The trustees of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
have told me we need to raise $25,000 just to complete all this
paperwork, as there are lots of fees associated with theses, and
we have to hire a CPA to sign the last bunch. . .obviously we did
the easiest and least expensive states first.

Neither of our trustees have the time to do all this by themselves,
so we also have to pay for a 1/4 time assistant, even though our
trustees do serve pro bono.

We can't get on shows such as Oprah, Regis, Letterman and Leno
to do any demonstrations and fundraising until we are registered
in all 50 states, and probably also the District of Columbia, so
it's even more of a Catch-22 than it first appears. . . .

We are expecting to have approximately 4,000 Etexts online by the
end of the year, with nearly 2,000 volunteers whom we would like
to provide more support for in the areas of copyright research,
book finding, scanning, proofreading, etc.  Currently every one
of the Project Gutenberg sites around the world is operated by
a volunteer who provides all the disk space, bandwidth, etc.,
and we would love to buy our own drives for at least the two
major US sites on which we initially post our Etexts.


***

As of 05/16/01 contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado,
Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska,
South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Wyoming, South Carolina. = 18 states

We have completed filing in the following states, awaiting response:
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington,
Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

We are partially filed in Maryland, they wanted more information.

The last 5 states have such incredible paperwork that we haven't
quite been able to do it all yet. . .sorry. . . .
Alaska, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, West Virginia.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork
to legally request donations in all 50 states.  If
your state is not listed and you would like to know
if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in
states where we are not yet registered, we know
of no prohibition against accepting donations
from donors in these states who approach us with
an offer to donate.

Why Should *YOU* Support Project Gutenberg?

Because The Work of Project Gutenberg is:

1.  Permanent
2.  Free
3.  Available
4.  Useful
5.  Enlightening
6.  Growing

and, best of all

7.  Yours!


First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .and we are now supported by a Trust/
Foundation which will hopefully help continue the existence of PG
for more decades, or even centuries into the future.


2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our Etexts.


3.  Available

There are mirror sites wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last month or two, new
sites have been announced in Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary.
Contrary to the policies of most Etext operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our Etexts and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
Etexts to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg Etexts are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg Etexts in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classic books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language every month or two in 2001, please made sure
we have something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing

Project Gutenberg is now producing 50 Etexts/month, 600/year. . .
It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year,
and in a few years, with your support, we hope to do 1,000 Etexts
in a calendar year.

We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy whole
new bookshelves each and every month to hold them all the paper
editions we present. . .or just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg Etext, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of the that are copyrighted works.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .any time you
want. . .any place you want. . .and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now it it's 30th year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  It is
not like a museum or library, you won't come for a visit and NOT see
your effect right there for everyone to see and have. . . .

You won't find PBS showing all their shows from 30 years ago. . .
but the Project Gutenberg Etexts are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads Alice in Wonderland now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . . .

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
Etexts being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most Etexts you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that likely will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg Etext
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with minimal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these Etexts ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg Etext. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these Etexts just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

Thousands of Project Gutenberg Etexts are available, and no one is ever
charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the Etexts are done
by volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg Etexts are available from servers on all continents.
We are continually expanding the number of servers, and eventually hope to
have servers not just on every continent, but in every region, and then in
every country.  We are now working on sites in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read Etexts and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
Etexts on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our Etexts on disk years before the Internet
actually circled the globe.

Our Etexts are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete
editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our Etexts available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of Etexts.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make Etext available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with their
own favorite search engines, and to copy anywhere, any time.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Enlightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing

We are officially producing 50 Etexts per month at this time,
and unofficially we are producing even more.  Last year we averaged
about 75 per month for the second half of the year, and we are doing
the same this year.  At this rate, we will soon cross the boundary
of 1,000 Etexts produced in a single year.

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 30th year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

We should reach approximately 3,000 Etexts by the official end of 2001,
but since we are about a year ahead of schedule, this will likely take
place in the next few months.  [hee hee, when I started writing this a
month ago, I had no idea I might be announcing #3000 in THIS message!!!]

Here is how we got there:

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed our first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

>From 1980-1990 we completed our first Bible and Shakespeare,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus our total was 10 Etexts.
[We counted Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]

 1  per month in 1991
 2  per month in 1992
 4  per month in 1993
 8  per month in 1994 We reached a total of 100 Etexts
16  per month in 1995
32  per month in 1996
32  per month in 1997 We reached a total of 1,000 Etexts
36  per month in 1998
36  per month in 1999 We reached a total of 2,000 Etexts
36  per month in 2000
40  per month in 2001 for the first half of the year
then
50  per month in 2001 for the second half of the year
                      We reached a total of 3,000 Etext
                      with the last of the 2001 Etexts.
50  per month in 2002
100 per month in 2003 Should bring us back to schedule

We will end the "Official Year of 2002" with 3,600 Etexts!!!
This should happen on July 4, 2001, we are that far ahead of
this schedule. . . .


[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 3,500 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$2.86 as a street value of the average one of our books:  as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.  In fact, we are ~all the way
from using the $5 nominal value, thru the $4 value, that was
the result of our posting Etext #2500. . .and then we passed
$3 mark at Etext #3333 as it takes an ever increasing number
to bring the cost down another dollar
. . .this time it will take 833 more Etexts. . .last time it
only took 500 more. . .next time it will take 1666 to get it
from $3 to $2. . .and then 5000 more to get nominal price of
a book down to $1 and still give away $1 trillion in Etexts.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001. . .obviously we have to revise it
some time this year. . .as we will perhaps get to #4000.

This is a goal we may have already accomplished, though many
of the 10,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are working to get them posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are discussing this a
lot with the other Etext makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the Etexts makers is one of our major goals right now.

There are currently over 16,000 Etexts listed in the indices
of the Internet Public Library, and, as usually, between 20-
25% of them are from Project Gutenberg.  We are growing just
as fast as the total Etext production of the world, but this
could be accelerated quite a bit if we could do copyright on
more of the Etexts out there of "unknown origin."  We should
raise money to hire a copyright lawyer for this!


***

If we are going to continue on past our first goal of 10,000 Etexts,
we are going to need some Big Time public relations help, and some
Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the Etexts to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many Etexts. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for Etexts for years and just at
that present time FINALLY FOUND US. . . .  That means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in the November 8th edition
of TIME magazine, but we have received less than a dozen emails per
that article. . .what we really need to do is get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us. . . !

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

2.  Running group of 1,500 volunteers to generate 10,000 Etexts has
been something that IS a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do it. . .otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .but running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 Etext that are possible in the NEXT 10 years, is NOT easy
. . .even for someone such as myself. . .it will require more phone
lines and calls than I can afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own, so we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or, the
possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

Etexts in Various Languages

As you may be aware, this last year we have greatly expanded our
output of Etexts in languages other than English, including:


1.  English
2.  Latin
3.  French
4.  Italian
5.  German
6.  Spanish
7.  Chinese
8.  Japanese
9.  Swedish

18. Hebrew*
19. Old French*
20. Polish*
21  Russian*
22. Romanian*
[Those with an * are still in need of work]



1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

Presently, contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota,
Iowa, Indiana, and Vermont. As the requirements for other states
are met, additions to this list will be made and fund raising will
begin in the additional states. These donations should be made to
the "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation" and mailed to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109


Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 4,000th Etext.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 600 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 1,000 per year after the "official" listing of 2002.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>


8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

1.
Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but are being prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of people I would hope to count as my
friends are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives  [This needs a rewrite]

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

Hopefully it has been worth your while to read this far. . .and you will take
a moment to consider making a tax-deductible donation to Project Gutenberg as
we are, as once before, without any financial income, including myself. . .mh

Subject: [gweekly] gweekly created; gutnberg closed
From: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
To: "Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter" <gweekly@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 14:38:30 -0400

Gutnberg subscribers:

As mentioned by Michael Hart recently, the "gutnberg" list
has been closed.

Instead, there are two new mailing lists, "gweekly" and
"gmonthly"

At Michael's request, I have subscribed everyone who was
subscribed to "gutnberg" to BOTH "gweekly" and "gmonthly",
which is why you are getting this message.

Most people will probably want to unsubscribe from one
of the lists.  At the bottom of this message (and my
next message, to gmontly), you will find unsubscribe
instructions.  I will include more detailed instructions
and mailing list information in a message to "gmontly",
as well.

Sorry for the work involved in unsubscribing from one
of the lists, but it seemed easier than asking everyone
to re-subscribe themselves to one of the new lists.

Both gmonthly and gweekly will get newsletters from
Project Gutenberg about the  most recent etexts and other
news, events, and calls for volunteers.  The gweekly will
go out weekly, and so will be a somewhat quicker way to
find out about newly posted etexts.  Otherwise, the content
will be similar, and since both lists are moderated you will
not get a whole lot of messages.

** If you have opinions or comments about this change, please email 
** Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com> directly.  I'm just helping
** with setting up the mailing lists.  If you have technical
** problems, email me: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>

Thanks for your interest in Project Gutenberg!

Subject: [gmonthly] gmonthly welcome, and mailing list instructions
From: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
To: "Project Gutenberg Monthly Newsletter" <gmonthly@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 14:41:41 -0400

Gutnberg subscribers: You should have received my earlier message to
"gweekly" about the mailing list changes.

Below is a much more detailed information file about mailing lists.
At the bottom of this message, you will find personalized unsubscribe
instructions to help unsubscribe from gmonthly.

Remember that you are now on both gweekly and gmonthly.  You are
welcome to stay subscribed to both, but most people will probably want
to unsubscribe from one.  Since every message to the list includes
unsubscribe instructions, it's safe to wait for a little while to
decide which you want to keep.


Here is the mailinglist how-to document:

--------
Project Gutenberg has five mailing lists.  Here is information about
how to subscribe, unsubscribe, get your list configuration settings,
and retrieve back issues.

These are the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.  People interested in
receiving regulary newsletters and other announcements about the
Project Gutenberg etexts should subscribe to gweekly or gmonthly:

"gweekly"  = Weekly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gmonthly" = Monthly General Public Announcements, including the newsletter
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements for active volunteers
"gutvol-d" = Discussion among active volunteers
"hhelpers" = Heroic Helpers: Work tasks for active volunteers (approval needed)

The "hhelpers" list requires an invitation or approval to subscribe,
the others are open for anyone to subscribe.  

In May 2001, Michael Hart requested to divide the old "gutnberg" list
into two new lists:

  gmonthly (for monthly newsletters)
  gweekly  (for weekly newsletters)

Instead of "gutnberg", which has been inactivated, please subscribe to
one of these two lists.  Both receive the Project Gutenberg newsletter
on a monthly basis, but "gweekly" also receives weekly updates, which
help people to hear sooner about the latest books that were published
by Project Gutenberg.  Each list receives periodic announcements about
Project Gutenberg, as well.  Traffic is quite light on both.


To subscribe:

To SUBSCRIBE to any of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists, send an
email message to "lyris@listserv.unc.edu"

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain text such as:

	subscribe gmonthly Your True Name

Where "gmonthly" is the list to subscribe to, and "Your True Name" is
replaced by your actual name.  So if your name were Dudley P. Duck,
your message might contain:

	subscribe gmonthly Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Lyris gets it
from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "lyris@listserv.unc.edu" You can't
address your message to an address such as "listserv" or
"listprocessor" or "majordom".  However, for backward compatibility,
"listproc@lyris.unc.edu" still works, as does "lyris@lyris.unc.edu".


To Unsubscribe:

If you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware that MANY different
mailing lists relay the Newsletters from Project Gutenberg and Ask
Dr. Internet, and that it is possible you do not receive our
newsletters directly from us.  In any case of that nature, you would
have to deal with that mailing list directly.  If you look through the
email header information, you should be able to tell how you got it.

But if you are on OUR lists, unsubscribing is easy.  Send email to
"lyris@listserv.unc.edu" with the text:

	unsubscribe gmonthly

where "gmonthly" is replaced by the list you want to unsubscribe from.
In addition, personalized unsubscribe information is appended to every
message you get from all of the Project Gutenberg mailing lists.

***

Archives and personal settings:

The Lyris Web interface has an easy way to browse past mailing list
contents, and change some personal settings.  Visit
http://lyris.unc.edu and select one of the Project Gutenberg lists.

***

Trouble?

If you are having trouble subscribing, unsubscribing or with anything
else related to the mailing lists, please email
"owner-gutenberg@listserv.unc.edu" to contact the lists' (human)
administrator.

If you would just like a little more information about Lyris
features, you can find their help information at http://lyris.unc.edu/help

Subject: [gweekly] Columbus Day at Project Gutenberg
From: Michael Hart <hart@beryl.ils.unc.edu>
To: "Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter" <gweekly@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2001 12:31:14 -0400 (EDT)


Happy Columbus Day!

Here are a few new Project Gutenberg Etexts released today
in honor of one of the people who changed the world most.

Of course, in many circles Columbus has recently been
"decanonized". . .just compare the HUGE 400th anniversary
of 1492 as celebrated around the world and especially in
Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the silliness that
transpired on the 500th anniversary when it was decided
well in advance to portray Columbus as politically incorrect.

Columbus, himself, would tell you he was politically incorrect
for his entire life. . .and proud of it. . .and that it was a
requirement. . . .

So. . .Congratulations Columbus!!!

You actually did land on American soil, on several occasions,
much as those who rewrite history would pretend otherwise.

Here are the 9 Columbus Etexts released on October 12, 2001
[The official dates are much later because we are ahead of schedule]
[We ARE planning on fixing this]

Jun 2003 Christopher Columbus by F. Young entire    [CC#09][cc09vxxx.xxx]4116
Jun 2003 Christopher Columbus by Filson Young v8    [CC#08][cc08vxxx.xxx]4115

I hope you enjoy them. . . .

*Project Gutenberg Request for Support for October 25, 2001*

Today is St. Crispin's Day, the day immortalized in Henry V,
by William Shakespeare, in telling the Battle of Agincourt--
one of the major events of the last millennium.

It is also the anniversary of the Charge Of The Light Brigade
made famous by Alfred Lord Tennyson.

Much of the fame of the Crimean War and these battles is a
also a direct result of efforts of Florence Nightingale in
recreating the entire field of practical medicine.


***Hopefully You Will Help Us Make As Much Difference***


[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

People are beginning to take us for granted. . .for the first
time in our history. . .we didn't receive a single message of
congratulations as we passed a major milestone in posting our
Etext #4000. . . .  In one way it is VERY nice to know people
have stopped saying we won't be here next year, but it's also
a little scary not to receive the kind of vocal support heard
all these years as we were getting rolling.

Project Gutenberg is now producing 100 Etexts/month, 1200/year.

It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year.
Our volunteers produced 1,000 Etexts in the past 11 months, and
our next major goal is to reach 5,000 Etexts even sooner than it
took us to get from 3,000 to 4,000.


Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.


       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


   We Have Made It Much Easier To Donate [More Below]

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541
[Also sometimes referred to as a "federal tax id number."]

Currently we are in sort of a Catch-22 fundraising situation.
We are registered in about 2/3 of the states, with paperwork
in to get to all of them, but we don't have enough money
to reregister in all states. . .and the stack of paperwork
for these is literally as large as the person handling them.

The biggest part of this kind of Catch-22 situation is that
we are aware of at least one state that would fine us up to
$2,000 if we don't keep our registrations up to date.  You
can understand the terrible price we pay if we don't raise
enough money to even pay for all the legal paperwork and
registrations, we lose far more than what we might be able
to raise in that state.

The trustees of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
have told me that they have seen reputable reports that the cost
of complying with the laws of all 50 states runs approximately
$25,000 a year for small organizations and can go much higher
for larger organizations.  There are many fees associated with
compliance, such as renewal registration fees, the cost of an
audit by a CPA which some states require and fees for registered
agent services required in some states.

Obviously, we did the easiest and least expensive states first,
but some are the most difficult and expensive states are key states
with large populations that we need to reach.

None of our trustees have the time to do all this by themselves,
so we also have to pay for a 1/4 time assistant, even though our
trustees do serve pro bono.  Please note that we are in the process
of incorporating, so most Trustees will be on the Board of Directors.

We are unsure how states where we are not registered would view
appearances on national shows, such as Oprah, Regis, Letterman and Leno.
If they viewed these efforts as fundraising in their states, it could
cause serious problems.  So we are in even more of a Catch-22 than it
might appear at first, until we are registered in all 50 states,
and the District of Columbia.

We are expecting to have approximately 4,000 Etexts online by the
end of this week, with nearly 2,000 volunteers whom we would like
to provide more support for in the areas of copyright research,
book finding, scanning, proofreading, etc.  Currently every one
of the Project Gutenberg sites around the world is operated by
a volunteer who provides all the disk space, bandwidth, etc.,
and we would love to buy our own drives for at least the two
major US sites on which we initially post our Etexts.

First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was founded to
ensure the continued existence and viability of our mission for
more decades, or even centuries into the future. . .with your help."

2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
wide variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our Etexts.


3.  Available

Project Gutenberg makes Etexts available in the easiest formats
to read, search, quote, etc. . .this is particularly important
to the visually impaired who use various programs to read aloud.

Contrary to the policies of most Etext operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our Etexts and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.  Most sites actively discourage
reposting of their files because they want all the hits.

Because of our unusual free access policy, volunteers have
created mirror sites in wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last year or two, new
PG sites are up in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Hungary,
in addition to more sites in the United States and Canada.
Contrary to the policies of most Etext operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our Etexts and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,

include in our collection.  Most sites actively discourage
reposting of their files because they want all the hits.

"There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit."  Anonymous

We don't care about getting the credit, we just want to
do the work.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
Etexts to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg Etexts are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg Etexts in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classic books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language every month or two in 2002, please make sure
we add something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing


We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy a whole
new bookshelf each and every month to hold all the paper editions
we present *OR* just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg Etext, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of them that are copyrighted works, but you can still give those
away to anyone you like.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .
any time you want. . .any place you want. . .
and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now in it's 30th year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  Your
contributions will be online for everyone to see from the moment of
the Newsletter announcements and will be listed in all the catalogs
on the Internet.

You won't find TV showing all their shows from 30 years ago. . .
but the Project Gutenberg Etexts are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads Alice in Wonderland now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . . .

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
Etexts being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most Etexts you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that likely will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg Etext
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with minimal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these Etexts ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg Etext. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these Etexts just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

4,000 of Project Gutenberg titles are now available, and end users are
never charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the Etexts
are done by volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg Etexts are available from servers on all continents.
We hope to the number of servers will continually increase, and eventually
hope to have servers not just on every continent, but in every region,
and then in every country.  New sites are now in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read Etexts and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
Etexts on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our Etexts on disk years before the
Internet actually circled the globe.

Our Etexts are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete
editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our Etexts available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of Etexts.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make Etext available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with their
own favorite search engines, and to copy anywhere, any time.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Enlightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing


Project Gutenberg is now producing 100 Etexts/month, 1200/year.
It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year.
Our volunteers produced 1,000 Etexts in the past 11 months, and
we hope reach a total of 5,000 as quickly as possible, perhaps
even to double our scheduled production goals to 200 per month
as we pass #5000.

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 30th year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

Here is brief timeline from the 1st Etext in 1971
to the current production of #4000.

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed the first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

From 1980-1990 the first Bible and Shakespeare were completed,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus the total was 10 Etexts.
[Counting all of Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]

 1  per month in 1991
 2  per month in 1992
 4  per month in 1993
 8  per month in 1994 total of 100 Etexts
16  per month in 1995
32  per month in 1996
32  per month in 1997 total of 1,000 Etexts
36  per month in 1998
36  per month in 1999 total of 2,000 Etexts
36  per month in 2000
40  per month in 2001 for the first half of the year
then
50  per month in 2001 for the second half of the year
                      a total of 3,000 Etexts
                      with the last of the 2001 Etexts.
50  per month in 2002
100 per month in 2003 Should bring us back to schedule

Well. . .it DIDN'T. . .we started an official schedule to do
100 eTexts per month on the 30th anniversary of the first of
these Etexts to be posted on the pre-stages of the Internet.
Since that 30th Anniversary celebration, the Etext production
total has been so far over 100 per month that we might have
an entire extra month of 100 by the end of the year.

If we can obtain more solid funding and increased volunteering,
we hope to set a goal of 200 Etexts a month for our 2004 releases.

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Do We Provide Access to A Trillion Dollars Of Etext Yet?!?!?

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 4,000 Etexts
to 1.62% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$2.50 as a street value of the average one of our books:  as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.

1.62% of the world's population is 100,000,000 people as per
the "World Population Clock."  Thus, if our average Etext is
able to reach 1.62% of the people, that would hopefully mean
we have provided a trillion copies to the world at large.

When we get to #5000 it will take only a nominal $2.00, but,
and it's a BIG "but". . .then it will take 5,000 more to get
to our original goal of giving away a $1 trillion in books--
at a value of only $1 per book.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of eText.

What about the original goal set 30 years ago?

This goal may have already been accomplished. . .though many
of the 10,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are hoping to see these posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are discussing this a
lot with the other Etext makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the Etexts makers is one of our major goals right now.

There are currently over 18,000 Etexts listed in the indices
of the Internet Public Library, and, as usually, between 20-
25% of them are from Project Gutenberg.  We are growing just
as fast as the total Etext production of the world, but this
could be accelerated quite a bit if we could do much more of
the copyright research necessary to include many more Etexts
of "unknown origin."

We should raise money to hire a copyright lawyer for this!


***

If we are going to continue on past the first goal of 10,000 Etexts,
we are going to need some Big Time public relations help, and some
Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the Etexts to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many Etexts. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for Etexts for years, but barely
now have FINALLY found Project Gutenberg.  This means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in TIME magazine, but there
were less than a dozen emails Project Gutenberg received from these
very kind words. . .what we really need is to get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us, and do
the same for Letterman, Leno, Rosie, Regis and all the others.

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

We really need to find some Public Relations help!!!


2.  However, running this great group of volunteers to generate the
more than 1,000 new Etexts over the recently past eleven months has
been something that is a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do this:  otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .BUT running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 Etexts that may possibly be a next step, will NOT be easy
--even for people with a knack for it.  It would require more phone
lines and/or calls than even the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation could presently afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own. . .SO we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or--
the possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

Even if we have more volunteers to help, the Foundation needs to
actually hire some people to assure a basic level of continuous
coordination and support for volunteers, especially as the number
of volunteers increases.

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

[Those with an * are still in need of work]



1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]
[We will do this even for people working on other eText projects.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

These are the latest lists I have received:  [NOT authoritative]
Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, El Salvador,
Iceland, Japan, (South) Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Panama, the Philippines, Poland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Ukraine are all "life plus 50 years" countries,
or were last I checked.) and Portugal.  I have been told Turkey
should be included, can anyone verify that?

Life + 75: In Guatemala and Mexico, copyrights tend to last for the
lifetime of the author plus 75 years, with certain exceptions.

Life + 70:  Poland and much of EU, and Brazil



More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you would like to help us make eTexts available in the future,
please contact the following:
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
Jim Tinsley <jtinsley@pobox.com>
with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


3.
Proofreading

We have a variety of ways for you to help with Project Gutenberg.

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of us, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.

Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

As of 10/16/01 contributions are only being solicited from people in:
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.

Anything you can do in these states would be greatly appreciated,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our just released 4,000th Etext.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

[It did pass.  October 27, 1998 - the U.S. went from life plus 50 to
life plus 70 for works created after 1/1/78, and from 75 to 95 years
for many works published before 1978. . .but this doesn't change the
items that had already entered the public domain in the US, unlike a
reversion from public domain status to copyright status in countries
in the European Union and other locales.  Thus, the US copyright for
most works still cuts in at 1923. . .and this is scheduled to stay a
cutoff date until around 2020.]

So the rule of thumb we use most is that anything pre-1923 is ok.


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

1.
Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but are being prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs work best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
others do better on other fonts, page coloration, etc.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors than in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.


More on:

Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
Word's "compare" that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.

Remember:
Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Because of the type of tax exempt organization that the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation falls within, it is especially
important that our financial support come from as wide a base as possible.
So far, we have not received any local, regional or national grants,
but when we do obtain such funding, it will be even more important to
maintain broad public support as well.  To maintain our tax exempt status,
between 10% and 34% of our financial support must come from the public.

You are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives  [This needs a rewrite]

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

Hopefully it has been worth your while to read this far. . .and you will take
a moment to consider making a tax-deductible donation to Project Gutenberg as
we are, as once before, without any financial income, including myself. . .mh

Subject: [gweekly] Birthday Report
From: Michael Hart <hart@beryl.ils.unc.edu>
To: "Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter" <gweekly@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 2002 13:17:41 -0500 (EST)





As many of you are aware, I often send out reports on New Year's,
Project Gutenberg anniversaries, and even sometimes on birthdays.

As it happens, we are in the middle of a period of calendar events
worthy of mention, besides that today is the day I am officially
entering senior citizenship.


Just last week we had the honor and pleasure of announcing:

Project Gutenberg of Australia's 50th eBook:  Gone With The Wind


Next month we hope to be announcing:

Project Gutenberg's 5,000th eBook:  The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci

And about this same time we hope The Notebooks of Leonardo will also
be announced as the 20,000th entry in the Internet Public Library.

20,000 eBooks available free of charge in a single catalogue. . . !

At the 1990 Midwinter ALA meeting in Chicago, people stared at me in
total disbelief when I predicted that there would be 10,000 eBooks
by the beginning of 2002. . .and here we are only 7 weeks into 2002,
and there are likely already 20,000 eBooks on the Internet, it just
takes a while for the IPL to find them all and catalog them.

10 years ago today, there were approximately 20 eBooks available on
the Internet. . .FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE THERE ARE NOW A THOUSAND!!!


In addition to these remarkable achievements, I have asked the Project
Gutenberg Volunteers to make sure that today we publish 15 of the 47
eBooks they will likely produce this week, so I may have the great
pleasure of announcing:

!!!Project Gutenberg Has Published 1500 eBooks Since March 8, 2001!!!


The is truly remarkable, as our first 1500 took us from 1971 to 1998!


      ******* I CAN NEVER THANK OUR VOLUNTEERS ENOUGH! *******


In November of 2000, I was honored to announce Project Gutenberg's
3,000th eBook at the annual conference of the Hawaii Library Assn.

In November of 2001, I was *amazed* to announce Project Gutenberg's
4,000th eBook at the annual conference of the Hawaii Library Assn.

I have been invited back to an even larger conference there this year,
where it appears I may have the *incredible* honor to announce #6,000!

Last year Project Gutenberg completed 1,240 new eBooks!

This year we are averaging over 200 eBooks per month!!!

That means we could possibly do TWICE as many this year!!!

It is truly a remarkable honor for me to be able to speak of doing
THOUSANDS of new eBooks per year from our Project Gutenberg Volunteers.


                          It means:

                      THE FUTURE IS NOW!


10 years ago no one believed my dream that 100 million people would
each have free access to 10,000 eBooks today, BUT THEY DO!!!

If that rate of growth continues, even without anticipating any new
technological breakthroughs in the rate of increase, that means that
just by sticking to the growth pattern of the last 10 years that in
just 10 more years we will have a thousand eBooks for every single
eBook we have today. . .


                      20 MILLION eBOOKS!


This is going to require more than just the basement operations we
have seen in the past, if we are going to coordinate efforts to get
this much work done and make it easily available to the world.

As many of you are aware, I have bushels and bushels of copyright
research stored in my house, probably approaching 10,000 researches,
since we have to do about twice as many copyright researches as we
actually manage to get successfully completed and into publication.

My house cannot possibly hold paperwork for 20-40 million of these!

Therefore we have introduced electronic copyright research and have
been testing this for the last month or two, with the help of Dianne
Bean and Greg Newby, who deserve HUGE thanks!

Obviously we will need even more volunteers to work on copyright,
but at least we may have solved the physical storage problem. . . .

You may also be aware of the wonderful work of our Chief Cataloguer,
Alev Akman, who somehow manages to enter each of our 200+ new eBooks
per month into our catalogue, usually by within 48 hours of the time
they are announced in our Newsletter.  I don't know how she does it!
Our GREAT thanks!

We will also need more help with cataloguing if we are to reach into
the millions of eBooks.

Project Gutenberg has always been all volunteers.  I have paid for
most of Project Gutenberg's history out of pocket, and we hired our
first paid employee only months ago, when we needed someone to work
on all the paperwork required since Project Gutenberg became a non-
profit corporation.  Since Project Gutenberg really has no money,
we are each working for about $1,000 a month at the moment.

Paying people to work for Project Gutenberg has always been a serious
question we needed to address.  I, myself, may have averaged earning
some $1,000 per month during the history of Project Gutenberg, but I
knew it would be hard to find someone as crazy as myself to take over.
I started mentioning this over 10 years ago, and have only found one
single person willing to run Project Gutenberg, that is Greg Newby.

Greg has been the unpaid CEO of Project Gutenberg since incorporation,
and we have two unpaid Board Members. . .but Greg will not be able to
continue at this growing level of responsibility for long without some
compensation. . .especially as Project Gutenberg can literally take
every single moment you can give it. . .and use every moment well.

Therefore, my job description is changing. . .I would LIKE to have
been able to change it on a dime, but that is much harder than it looks,
even for someone such as myself.  Yet we are in the process of automating
much of the work I have done by hand for the last 30 years, so we can do
even more remarkable work in the next 30 years.

My job is now going to be to raise enough money and public awareness for
Project Gutenberg to be able to give away 100 times as many eBooks as we
are going in the first stage of our planning, and to get those eBooks to
10 times as many people.


THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME SERIOUS PUBLIC RELATIONS AND FUNDRAISING!!!


Project Gutenberg's first stage was to give 10,000 eBooks to 100,000,000
people, for a total of giving away 1,000,000,000,000 [1 Trillion] eBooks.

We are now crossing the half-way point towards accomplishing that goal!

Giving ten thousands eBooks to a hundred million people was certainly
within the realm of possibility for a basement operation. . .yes, I am
still writing you from the same desk in the same basement I was writing
from when you first started receiving the Project Gutenberg Newsletter
back in the 1980's. . .same kind of keyboard, monitor, and somewhat
bigger and faster hardware behind them.

If we are to give away 100 times as many books in the next 30 years,
and give them to 10 times as many people, that will mean we are going
to give away 1,000,000,000,000,000 [1 Quadrillion] eBooks. . .and that
will mean we need to get somewhat more organized, and not so dependent
on a single person. . .which we are doing right now. . .I have great
faith that Project Gutenberg would/could/should be able to survive if
something happens to me. . .and that is a GREAT feeling.

Giving away a million books to a billion people each is as great an
undertaking today as giving away a ten thousand books to one hundred
million people was when we started.

But at least we now have the track record to prove it can be done,
if we just keep on growing at the same rate as we have been for the
next 10 years. . .perhaps even giving away 20 million titles. . . .

However, when I started doing this 30 years ago, I had a reasonable
life expectancy to be relatively certainly I would live the 30 years
required to do 10,000 eBooks.

But today it is unreasonable to expect that I will live another such
period of existence and hard work.  It's possible. . .but we cannot
count on it. . .OK?

That's where the public relations and fundraising comes in. . . .

We can only expect to continue to reach about 1.6% of the population
of the world if we don't get more publicity, and to reach a billion
readers, we need to reach 16% of the world population. . .it's hard
to DO that without any public relations.

So, to accomplish these goals, we NEED to get on Letterman, Leno,
Oprah, Regis, Rosie, etc. . .and it takes thousands of letters and
emails and phone calls to do that. . .according to Oprah, last week,
when she did her annual show to reply to all those.

We have obviously never managed to get on ONE of those shows, even
though we could give away a million eBooks to each audience. . . .

WE NEED ***YOU*** TO HELP BREAK THROUGH THE PUBLICITY BARRIER!!!!!!!


Or else we will continual to be confined to reaching the 1.6% of the
population that more or less finds Project Gutenberg on their own.

I am continually amazed at how many emails I receive from people who
tell me they have been looking for something like eBooks for years,
and just now found Project Gutenberg by accident.

This means we are NOT getting the word out. . . .

In many respects it is just as important to reach an audience of
twice as many people as it is for us to publish twice as many books.
[Though I personally believe that nearly all the books posted on the
Internet are destined for immortality and easy reference, it would be
nice to get them to the widest possible audience as soon as possible.]

***

In addition to planning all the WORK we have laid out for the coming
years, decades, and hopefully more, we must plan for the ways we can
SUPPORT THE WORK DONE BY ALL OUR VOLUNTEERS.

This means creating institutions that will carry Project Gutenberg
into the future, even as each of our individuals comes and goes,
including myself.

We are VERY lucky to have Prof. Greg Newby at the helm as our CEO,
and we need to raise the money required to pay him at least the
average professor's salary if we are to keep him for the future.
At the moment he is doing all this work free of charge, but this
will likely have to change next year, so we have to be aware that
we are going have to support him if he is going to support us.

This, plus all the copyright research, computers, phone lines,
and paperwork required just to keep Project Gutenberg legally in
existence, as well as to do our actual work, means we are going
to have to change from being a "basement operation" to becoming
what I hope will be am interconnected federations of Project
Gutenberg institutions around the world, and hopefully several
support agencies as insurance against inevitable hardships.

To that end, we are trying to change my role in Project Gutenberg
and to make Project Gutenberg more independent from myself, so it
will continue when I cannot.

Thus I will be changing my priorities from just making sure all
the eBooks get out on time, to fundraising and public relations.

Many of you might not be aware just how difficult this is, I know
that _I_ had no idea when I first started testing the waters, but
it's VERY hard to even get to communicate with each of the people
we have on our lists, from the rich and famous in computers, to a
chance to give away our CDROMs in various public settings such as
television shows and public events.

HELP!!!

HELP US GET THE PUBLICITY WE NEED TO GIVE AWAY A QUADRILLION eBOOKS!

Ask everyone you know if they know anyone who can help with this!!!

It's harder to get the attention of these people than you may think!

But it's the only way to get the word to a billion people. . . .

Thank you so much!

***

On a more personal note, I must admit that I feel I have aged some
ten years in each of the last five years. . .I was doing a pretty
good imitation of being Twenty-Something until I hit fifty. . .and
many times since then I have felt I was doing a good imitation of
being Seventy-Something as the workload of Project Gutenberg went
from doing two books per month ten years ago to two hundred books
per month for the first two months of 2002.

Don't think I would trade this for anything else. . .there is NO
life ever lived that I would trade mine for. . .no satisfaction
I can imagine greater than doing Project Gutenberg. . .no legacy
I could leave greater than a group of people around the world who
publish thousands of free eBooks per year in an ever wider variety
of languages and give them to an ever wider variety of people.

As I write this, contemplating my life from the new vantage point
of being 55 years old, I feel very much a mirror image of how I was
feeling when I was ending my teenage years, when I had about as many
years under my belt as I now have in my statistical life expectancy,
only now I am looking toward the last two decades of my life rather
than looking from the first two decades of my life.

My only real regrets, and I DO have them, of course, are the people
I didn't get to know better. . . .

[and a few things I did that I probably shouldn't have done.]

I can't go back an undo any of those things, and perhaps they made
me stronger in my regrets for doing them, but I still hope to get
to know people better, even though it appears to be more difficult
these days than it did in the 60's. . . .

I also still have dreams of finding Princess Charming, and my offer
of a $1,000 reward to whomever introduces us still stands, and may
actually be increased as time goes on, especially if I want to have
kids and see them finish high school.

So there it is, a message from my 55th birthday, hopefully covering
all that needs to be covered, and encouraging you enough to act, to
live, perchance to dream. . .as I do.

THANK YOU ALL SOOOOOOO MUCH!!!

Michael

It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year.
Our volunteers produced 1,650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
our next major goal is to double our 5,000 eBooks by end of 2003!


Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.


       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


   We Have Made It Much Easier To Donate [More Below]

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541
[Also sometimes referred to as a "federal tax id number."]

Currently we are in sort of a Catch-22 fundraising situation.
We are registered in most of the 50 states, with paperwork
in to get to all of them, but we don't have enough money
to reregister in all states. . .and the stack of paperwork
for these is literally as large as the person handling them.

The biggest part of this kind of Catch-22 situation is that
we are aware of at least one state that would fine us up to
$2,000 if we don't keep our registrations up to date.  You
can understand the terrible price we pay if we don't raise
enough money to even pay for all the legal paperwork and
registrations, we lose far more than what we might be able
to raise in that state.

The trustees of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
have told me that they have seen reputable reports that the cost
of complying with the laws of all 50 states runs approximately
$25,000 a year for small organizations and can go much higher
for larger organizations.  There are many fees associated with
compliance, such as renewal registration fees, the cost of an
audit by a CPA which some states require and fees for registered
agent services required in some states.

Obviously, we did the easiest and least expensive states first,
but some are the most difficult and expensive states are key states
with large populations that we need to reach.

None of our trustees have the time to do all this by themselves,
so we also have to pay for a 1/4 time assistant, even though our
trustees do serve pro bono.  Please note that we are in the process
of incorporating, so most Trustees will be on the Board of Directors.

We are unsure how states where we are not registered would view
appearances on national shows, such as Oprah, Regis, Letterman and Leno.
If they viewed these efforts as fundraising in their states, it could
cause serious problems.  So we are in even more of a Catch-22 than it
might appear at first, until we are registered in all 50 states,
and the District of Columbia.

We are expecting to have approximately 10,000 eBooks online by the
end of next year, with nearly 2,000 volunteers whom we would like
to provide more support for in the areas of copyright research,
book finding, scanning, proofreading, etc.  Currently every one
of the Project Gutenberg sites around the world is operated by
a volunteer who provides all the disk space, bandwidth, etc.,
and we would love to buy our own drives for at least the two
major US sites on which we initially post our eBooks.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541,
and has been approved as a 501(c)(3) organization by the US Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).  Donations are tax-deductible to the maximum
extent permitted by law.  As the requirements for other states are met,
additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the
additional states.


In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork

First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was founded to
ensure the continued existence and viability of our mission for
more decades, or even centuries into the future. . .with your help."

2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
wide variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our eBooks.


3.  Available

Project Gutenberg makes eBooks available in the easiest formats
to read, search, quote, etc. . .this is particularly important
to the visually impaired who use various programs to read aloud.

Contrary to the policies of most eBook operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our eBooks and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.  Most sites actively discourage
reposting of their files because they want all the hits.

Because of our unusual free access policy, volunteers have
created mirror sites in wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last year or two, new
PG sites are up in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Hungary,
in addition to more sites in the United States and Canada.

"There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit."  Anonymous

We don't care about getting the credit, we just want to
do the work.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
eBooks to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg eBooks are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg eBooks in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classic books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language every month or two in 2002, please make sure
we add something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing


We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy a whole
new bookshelf each and every month to hold all the paper editions
we present *OR* just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg eBook, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of them that are copyrighted works, but you can still give those
away to anyone you like.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .
any time you want. . .any place you want. . .
and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now in it's 31st year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  Your
contributions will be online for everyone to see from the moment of
the Newsletter announcements and will be listed in all the catalogs
on the Internet.

You won't find TV showing all their shows from 30 years ago. . .but
the Project Gutenberg eBooks are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads Alice in Wonderland now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . . .

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
eBooks being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most eBooks you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that likely will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg eBook
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with minimal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these eBooks ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg eBook. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these eBooks just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

4,000 of Project Gutenberg titles are now available, and end users are
never charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the eBooks
are done by volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg eBooks are available from servers on all continents.
We hope to the number of servers will continually increase, and eventually
hope to have servers not just on every continent, but in every region,
and then in every country.  New sites are now in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read eBooks and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
eBooks on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our eBooks on disk years before the
Internet actually circled the globe.

Our eBooks are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete
editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our eBooks available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of eBooks.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make eBooks available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with their
own favorite search engines, and to copy anywhere, any time.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Enlightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing


Project Gutenberg is now producing 200 eBooks/month, 2400/year.
It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 eBook year.
Our volunteers produced 1,650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
we hope reach a total of 10,000 as quickly as possible, perhaps
even by the end of next year.

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 30th year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

Here is brief timeline from the 1st Etext in 1971
to the current production of #4000.

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed the first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

>From 1980-1990 the first Bible and Shakespeare were completed,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus the total was 10 Etexts.
[Counting all of Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]

eBooks per month per year

 1  in 1991 We released The Bible as #10.
 2  in 1992
 4  in 1993
 8  in 1994 We released The Complete Shakespeare as #100.
16  in 1995
32  in 1996
32  in 1997 [we lost our funding for that year, and barely survived]
36  in 1998 [kept this schedule for first half and then in second half
            we completed two months during each month for 72 per month]
36  in 1999 [is our official schedule, we are now about 8 months ahead,
            but, as luck would have it, on the day the muse struck to
            write this article, I learned that our funding is again lost.]
40  in 2000 [I was never personally comfortable doing over 30 per month,
50  in 2001 so this is when I started planning all the delegating of today]
100 in 2001 [Starting on our 30th Anniversay, and we thought we would NEVER
            be able to do this many, so it would bring us back on schedule,
            but so far, only three months later, we have. . .so who knows.]
            [Note added in January, 2002, we managed to do 1240 in 2001, so
            we did somehow manage to average 100 per month--who knows how.]
200 in 2002 We started 2002 with an incredible 200 eBooks per month, and it
            is amazing, but we are still on that schedule.


Here are some of the highlights:

####  Date  Title

   1  1971  The U.S. Declaration of Independence
            July 4, 1971
  10  1990  The King James Bible
 100  1994  The Complete Works of William Shakespeare
            December 10, 1993
1000  1997  Dante's Divine Comedy, In Italian
2000  1999  Don Quixote, In Spanish
3000  2000  A L'Ombre Des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs V3 by Proust, In French
4000  2001  The Complete Works of "The French Immortals", In English
5000  2002  The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, In English
            April 10, 2002

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
eBooks online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Do We Provide Access to A Trillion Dollars Of Etext Yet?!?!?

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 5,000 eBooks
to 1.61% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$1.97 as a street value of the average one of our books:  as
our population has passed 6 billion around the official date
of release of our eBook #2000.

1.61% of the world's population is 100,000,000 people as per
the "World Population Clock."  Thus, if our average eBook is
able to reach 1.61% of the people, that would hopefully mean
we have provided a trillion copies to the world at large.

When we got to #5000 it then took only a nominal $2.00, but,
and it's a BIG "but". . .then it will take 5,000 more to get
to our original goal of giving away a $1 trillion in books--
at a value of only $1 per book.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of eBooks for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of Etext.

What about the original goal set 30 years ago?

This goal may have already been accomplished. . .though many
of the 20,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are hoping to see these posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are discussing this a
lot with the other eBook makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the eBook makers is one of our major goals right now.

There are currently over 20,000 eBooks listed in the indices
of the Internet Public Library, and, as usual between 20-25%
of them are from Project Gutenberg.

We should raise money to hire a copyright lawyer for this to
help us work on copyright research for many of the eBooks of
"unknown origin" that we can't republish yet.

***

If we are going to continue on past the first goal of 10,000 eBook
titles, then we are going to need some Big Time Public Relations--
and some Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the eBooks to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many eBooks. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for eBooks for years, but barely
now have FINALLY found Project Gutenberg.  This means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in TIME magazine, but there
were less than a dozen emails Project Gutenberg received from these
very kind words. . .what we really need is to get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us, and do
the same for Letterman, Leno, Rosie, Regis and all the others.

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

We really need to find some Public Relations help!!!


2.  However, running this great group of volunteers to generate the
more than 1,500 new eBooks over the recently past eleven months has
been something that is a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do this:  otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .BUT running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 eBooks that may possibly be a next step, will NOT be easy
--even for people with a knack for it.  It would require more phone
lines and/or calls than even the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation could presently afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own. . .SO we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or--
the possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

Even if we have more volunteers to help, the Foundation needs to
actually hire some people to assure a basic level of continuous
coordination and support for volunteers, especially as the number
of volunteers increases.

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]
[We will do this even for people working on other eBook projects.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

These are the latest lists I have received:  [NOT authoritative]
Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, El Salvador,
Iceland, Japan, (South) Korea, Latvia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand,
Panama, the Philippines, Poland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Ukraine are all "life plus 50 years" countries,
or were last I checked.) and Portugal.  I have been told Turkey
should be included, can anyone verify that?

Life + 75: In Guatemala and Mexico, copyrights tend to last for the
lifetime of the author plus 75 years, with certain exceptions.

Life + 70:  Poland and much of EU, and Brazil



More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you would like to help us make eBooks available in the future,
please contact the following:
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
Jim Tinsley <jtinsley@pobox.com>
with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


3.
Proofreading

We have a variety of ways for you to help with Project Gutenberg.

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on eBooks for
us is if they can ship their book to one of us, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to eBook for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.

Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Anything you can do in these states would be greatly appreciated,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our just released 5,000th eBook.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 300 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
eBooks for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.

Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having eBook archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for eBooks to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as eBooks, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

[It did pass.  October 27, 1998 - the U.S. went from life plus 50 to
life plus 70 for works created after 1/1/78, and from 75 to 95 years
for many works published before 1978. . .but this doesn't change the
items that had already entered the public domain in the US, unlike a
reversion from public domain status to copyright status in countries
in the European Union and other locales.  Thus, the US copyright for
most works still cuts in at 1923. . .and this is scheduled to stay a
cutoff date until around 2020.]

So the rule of thumb we use most is that anything pre-1923 is ok.


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an eBook and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our eBooks,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough eBook version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but are being prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs work best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
others do better on other fonts, page coloration, etc.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most eBook providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an eBook
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg eBooks are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of eBooks prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
eBook enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new eBook with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of eBooks, many of which have vastly more errors than in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial eBooks.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg eBooks is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
eBook or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.


More on:

Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
Word's "compare" that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our eBooks, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror eBooks should not suffer any.

Remember:
Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Because of the type of tax exempt organization that the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation falls within, it is especially
important that our financial support come from as wide a base as possible.
So far, we have not received any local, regional or national grants,
but when we do obtain such funding, it will be even more important to
maintain broad public support as well.  To maintain our tax exempt status,
between 10% and 34% of our financial support must come from the public.

You are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives  [This needs a rewrite]

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.

Hopefully it has been worth your while to read this far. . .and you will take
a moment to consider making a tax-deductible donation to Project Gutenberg as
we are, as once before, without any financial income, including myself. . .mh

*Project Gutenberg Request for Support for September 27, 2002*

               WE   NEED   YOUR   HELP   !!!

We need to reach a wider audience if we are going to give away
the ONE TRILLION eBooks that has been our goal for many years.

We particularly need help with FTPing eBook files to our sites
once 99% of the work has been done in their preparation. . . !

WE also need ISP support for Project Gutenberg of Australia--
if you know any sites down under.

[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]


Please help us reach more readers. . .send us email addresses
for anyone you know in the media. . .if no email address then
web addresses.  Thank you so much!  MUCH MORE IS BELOW!!!


It Has Been Six Months Since Our Last Such Request Last Spring

Since that time we have moved through 5,000 eBooks to 6,000!!!


         And, WITH YOUR HELP, we want to try to make
         it eBook #10,000 by the end of next year!!!

Also, we have just purchased and installed a new super-scanner
for the Distributed Proofreaders, so we can scan more books.
You can contact them do proofing or to send books at:
http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg

We are working to set up a way to collect books for this, so I
ask you to keep an eye out at the garage sales & library sales.



With the presentation of our 6,000th eBook this very week,
Project Gutenberg officially passed the 60% marker in this
attempt to give a total of 10,000 eBooks to 100 million of
the world's readers, and to help create more readers along
the way.


In 2001 Project Gutenberg published 1240 new eBooks.

Project Gutenberg has been producing 200 eBooks/month, 2400/year.

It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year.
Our volunteers produced 1,650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
our next major goal is to reach 10,000 eBooks by the end of 2003!


Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.


       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


   We Have Made It Much Easier To Donate [More Below]

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541
[Also sometimes referred to as a "federal tax id number."]

Currently we are in sort of a Catch-22 fundraising situation.
We are registered in most of the 50 states, with paperwork
in to get to all of them, but we don't have enough money
to reregister in all states. . .and the stack of paperwork
for these is literally as large as the person handling them.

The biggest part of this kind of Catch-22 situation is that
we are aware of at least one state that would fine us up to
$2,000 if we don't keep our registrations up to date.  You
can understand the terrible price we pay if we don't raise
enough money to even pay for all the legal paperwork and
registrations, we lose far more than what we might be able
to raise in that state.

The trustees of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
have told me that they have seen reputable reports that the cost
of complying with the laws of all 50 states runs approximately
$25,000 a year for small organizations and can go much higher
for larger organizations.  There are many fees associated with
compliance, such as renewal registration fees, the cost of an
audit by a CPA which some states require and fees for registered
agent services required in some states.

Obviously, we did the easiest and least expensive states first,
but some are the most difficult and expensive states are key states
with large populations that we need to reach.

None of our trustees have the time to do all this by themselves,
so we also have to pay for a 1/4 time assistant, even though our
trustees do serve pro bono.  Please note that we are in the process
of incorporating, so most Trustees will be on the Board of Directors.

We are unsure how states where we are not registered would view
appearances on national shows, such as Oprah, Regis, Letterman and Leno.
If they viewed these efforts as fundraising in their states, it could
cause serious problems.  So we are in even more of a Catch-22 than it
might appear at first, until we are registered in all 50 states,
and the District of Columbia.

We are expecting to have approximately 10,000 eBooks online by the
end of next year, with nearly 2,000 volunteers whom we would like
to provide more support for in the areas of copyright research,
book finding, scanning, proofreading, etc.  Currently every one
of the Project Gutenberg sites around the world is operated by
a volunteer who provides all the disk space, bandwidth, etc.,
and we would love to buy our own drives for at least the two
major US sites on which we initially post our eBooks.

First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was founded to
ensure the continued existence and viability of our mission for
more decades, or even centuries into the future. . .with your help."

2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
wide variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our eBooks.


3.  Available

Project Gutenberg makes eBooks available in the easiest formats
to read, search, quote, etc. . .this is particularly important
to the visually impaired who use various programs to read aloud.

Contrary to the policies of most eBook operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our eBooks and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.  Most sites actively discourage
reposting of their files because they want all the hits.

Because of our unusual free access policy, volunteers have
created mirror sites in wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last year or two, new
PG sites are up in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Hungary,
in addition to more sites in the United States and Canada.

"There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit."  Anonymous

We don't care about getting the credit, we just want to
do the work.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
eBooks to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg eBooks are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg eBooks in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classic books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language every month or two in 2002, please make sure
we add something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing


We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy a whole
new bookshelf each and every month to hold all the paper editions
we present *OR* just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg eBook, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of them that are copyrighted works, but you can still give those
away to anyone you like.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .
any time you want. . .any place you want. . .
and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now in its 32nd year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  Your
contributions will be online for everyone to see from the moment of
the Newsletter announcements and will be listed in all the major
search engines and catalogs on the Internet.

You won't find TV showing all the shows from 30 years ago. . .but
the Project Gutenberg eBooks are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads any of our eBooks now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . .and
their kids are growing up with the same traditions.

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
eBooks being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most eBooks you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that likely will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg eBook
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with minimal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these eBooks ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg eBook. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these eBooks just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

6,000 Project Gutenberg titles are now available, and end users are
never charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the eBooks
are done by our volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg eBooks are available from servers on all continents.
We hope to the number of servers will continually increase, and eventually
hope to have servers not just on every continent, but in every region,
and then in every country.  New sites are now in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read eBooks and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
eBooks on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our eBooks on disk years before the
Internet actually circled the globe.

Our eBooks are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete
editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our eBooks available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of eBooks.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make eBooks available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with search
engines of all varieties, not just those designed to parse through markup
systems of a particular variety.  We also provide conversions into markup
formats for many of these.  These are not trivially created by programmed
output only, but are the creations of days of work by our volunteers.  In
addition, the plain text versions are great for our blind readers who use
programs to read aloud to them.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Enlightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing


Project Gutenberg is now producing 200 eBooks/month, 2400/year.
It was only 5 years ago that we managed our first 100 eBook year.
Our volunteers produced 1,650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
we hope reach a total of 10,000 as quickly as possible, perhaps
even by the end of next year, only 15 months from now. . . .

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 30th year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

Here is brief timeline from the 1st Etext in 1971
to the current production of #4000.

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed the first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

>From 1980-1990 the first Bible and Shakespeare were completed,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus the total was 10 Etexts.
[Counting all of Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]
[This particular edition of Shakespeare is still copyrighted,
even now, 20 years later, due to TWO copyright extensions in
the 31 year history of Project Gutenberg, which have removed
two million books from the list we could put online.

eBooks per month per year

 1  in 1991 We released The Bible as #10.
 2  in 1992
 4  in 1993
 8  in 1994 We released The Complete Shakespeare as #100.
16  in 1995
32  in 1996
32  in 1997 [we lost our funding for that year, and barely survived]
36  in 1998 [kept this schedule for first half and then in second half
            we completed two months during each month for 72 per month]
36  in 1999 [is our official schedule, we are now about 8 months ahead,
            but, as luck would have it, on the day the muse struck to
            write this article, I learned that our funding is again lost.]
40  in 2000 [I was never personally comfortable doing over 30 per month,
50  in 2001 so this is when I started planning all the delegating of today]
100 in 2001 [Starting on our 30th Anniversay, and we thought we would NEVER
            be able to do this many, so it would bring us back on schedule,
            but so far, only three months later, we have. . .so who knows.]
            [Note added in January, 2002, we managed to do 1240 in 2001, so
            we did somehow manage to average 100 per month--who knows how.]
200 in 2002 We started 2002 with an incredible 200 eBooks per month, and it
            is amazing, and we are still very close to that.  Right now we
            have an average of 198 per month for the first 8 1/2 months.


Here are some of the highlights:

####  Date  Title

   1  1971  The U.S. Declaration of Independence [July 4, 1971]
  10  1990  The King James Bible
 100  1994  The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [December 10, 1993]
1000  1997  Dante's Divine Comedy, In Italian[September 1, 1997]
2000  1999  Don Quixote, In Spanish [April 23, 1999]
3000  2000  A L'Ombre Des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs V3 by Proust, In French
4000  2001  The Complete Works of "The French Immortals", In English
5000  2002  The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, In English [April 10, 2002]
6000  2002  Our First Polish eBook "Ironia Pozorow" [September, 2002]

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
eBooks online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Do We Provide Access to A Trillion Dollars Of Etext Yet?!?!?

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 6,000 eBooks
to 1.6% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$1.67 as a street value of the average one of our books:
our population has passed 6.25 billion about the same time
we released Project Gutenberg eBook #6000.

Next year, as the population grows, this percentage should
fall into the 1.5x% range; and as the population should be
leveling out just before we reach 10 billion:  this figure
may never quite reach 1% = 100 million people.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of eBooks for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of Etext.

What about the original goal set 30 years ago?

This goal may have already been accomplished. . .though many
of the 20,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are hoping to see these posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are discussing this a
lot with the other eBook makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the eBook makers is one of our major goals right now.

There are currently over 20,000 eBooks listed in the indices
of the Internet Public Library, and, as usual between 20-25%
of them are from Project Gutenberg.

We should raise money to hire a copyright lawyer for this to
help us work on copyright research for many of the eBooks of
"unknown origin" that we can't republish yet.

***

If we are going to continue on past the first goal of 10,000 eBook
titles, then we are going to need some Big Time Public Relations--
and some Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the eBooks to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many eBooks. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for eBooks for years, but barely
now have FINALLY found Project Gutenberg.  This means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in TIME magazine, but there
were less than a dozen emails Project Gutenberg received from these
very kind words. . .what we really need is to get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us, and do
the same for Letterman, Leno, Rosie, Regis and all the others.

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

We really need to find some Public Relations help!!!


2.  However, running this great group of volunteers to generate the
more than 1,500 new eBooks over the recently past eleven months has
been something that is a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do this:  otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .BUT running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 eBooks that may possibly be a next step, will NOT be easy
--even for people with a knack for it.  It would require more phone
lines and/or calls than even the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation could presently afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own. . .SO we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or--
the possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

Even if we have more volunteers to help, the Foundation needs to
actually hire some people to assure a basic level of continuous
coordination and support for volunteers, especially as the number
of volunteers increases.

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

The Distributed Proofreaders work in a variety of languages.

Also, we have just purchased and installed a new super-scanner
for the Distributed Proofreaders (http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg)
so we can scan more books.  We will also help with copyright research.

*

1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]
[We will do this even for people working on other eBook projects.]
[This can now be done by sending us scans as email attachments!!!]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

We will help you do the copyright research for your chosen books,
the laws are changing, perhaps even in the next few weeks, so I am
not including anything specific at the moment.  We try to keep lists
of copyright laws around the world, so please help us keep up to date
when you hear of any changes.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you would like to help us make eBooks available in the future,
please contact the following:
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
Jim Tinsley <jtinsley@pobox.com>
with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


3.
Proofreading

We have a variety of ways for you to help with Project Gutenberg.

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on eBooks for
us is if they can ship their book to one of us, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to eBook for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.

Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New

Anything you can do in these states would be greatly appreciated,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our just released 5,000th eBook.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 300 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
eBooks for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.

Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having eBook archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for eBooks to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as eBooks, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

[It did pass.  October 27, 1998 - the U.S. went from life plus 50 to
life plus 70 for works created after 1/1/78, and from 75 to 95 years
for many works published before 1978. . .but this doesn't change the
items that had already entered the public domain in the US, unlike a
reversion from public domain status to copyright status in countries
in the European Union and other locales.  Thus, the US copyright for
most works still cuts in at 1923. . .and this is scheduled to stay a
cutoff date until around 2020.]

So the rule of thumb we use most is that anything pre-1923 is ok.


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an eBook and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our eBooks,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough eBook version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

1.
Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but are being prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs work best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
others do better on other fonts, page coloration, etc.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most eBook providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an eBook
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg eBooks are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of eBooks prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
eBook enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new eBook with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of eBooks, many of which have vastly more errors than in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial eBooks.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg eBooks is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
eBook or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.


More on:

Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
Word's "compare" that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our eBooks, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror eBooks should not suffer any.

Remember:
Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Because of the type of tax exempt organization that the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation falls within, it is especially
important that our financial support come from as wide a base as possible.
So far, we have not received any local, regional or national grants,
but when we do obtain such funding, it will be even more important to
maintain broad public support as well.  To maintain our tax exempt status,
between 10% and 34% of our financial support must come from the public.

You are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

We need people who can help us save eBooks that have been put online,
but without enough information to verify they are out of copyright.
This usually is done by comparing the first and last pages of each
chapter to a paper edition we can be sure is out of copyright.

If you can either help us find these eBooks, or their counterparts in
pre-1923 paper editions, you can help preserve these eBooks online,
otherwise they will are eventually likely to be deleted.

Project Gutenberg Needs YOU. . .NOW!!!

We Could Reach 10,000 eBooks This Year With Your Help!!!

Details Follow
[in longer note]

You can make history.

You can become an Internet pioneer.

You can be someone who will never be forgotten.

You can be part of the first 1% of the 1,000,000 eBooks
Project Gutenberg is planning to put on the Internet. . .
free eBooks. . .for everyone throughout the rest of history.

April 10, 2002 was the day Project Gutenberg reached 5,000 eBooks.

By Moore's Law October 10, 2003 could be the day for #10,000. . . .

We are just over half way. . .7,661 as I write this. . .2,339 to go!

That will take over 300 eBooks per month, we need you to help us push
our average up from 268 per month to get to 10,000 by December, 31st!

I bet a free dinner #10,000 will come by November, Charles Franks
bet it will be December, and various mathematical predictions have a
range from October 10th to January 21st.

YOU can make history. . .YOU can make this date a day earlier simply
by helping add a book a month to our current total of 7,650 eBooks--
and all you have to do is read a book a month and tell us the errors
we need to fix. . .we will supply the books, scan them, and put them
on line so you can see them and help correct them.

You can do this with our Distributed Proofreaders:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp

Or you can buy any of your favorite books from before 1923, and send
them to us for scanning, or you can scan or type them yourself.

Just under 14 books per day, and #10,000 could be on October 10!!!
Just over 12 books per day, and that day could be October 28
Just over 11 books per day, and that day could be November 15
Just over 10 books per day, and that day could be December 7
Just over 9 books per day, and that day would be January 3
Just over 8 books per day, and that day would be February 5

This CAN be done!!!!!!!

So far this year:

57 books per week in January
62 per week in February
67 in March. . . .

YOU can help us start doing 77 books per month!!!

I hope to be thanking you soon for your help in breaking down
the bars of ignorance and illiteracy.

Thanks!!!

***Project Gutenberg Request for Support for April 15, 2003***

 [This is a blatant request for support of Project Gutenberg
 Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!]


               WE   NEED   YOUR   HELP   !!!

               [Our Top Ten Requests At End]

This year we hope to reach our initial goals of making 10,000
eBooks and giving them to 100,000,000 people around the world
for a total of 1,000,000,000,000 = 1 Trillion eBook copies!!!

At the moment we are averaging just over 60 eBooks per week =
just over 250 per month, but we need to average 77 per week =
just over 300 per month if we are going to keep up our growth
rate we have established since we had 10 eBooks in 1990.

    This will require an additional 15 eBooks per week.

We have made it easier and easier for you to help us, and now
you can proofread a page or two any time you have a moment at
Distributed Proofreaders.

***

WE also need ISP support for Project Gutenberg of Australia--
if you know any sites down under that have high bandwidth, as
well as needing a few sites for PG of the US that have 24 hrs
of very wide symmetric bandwidth [more than DSL or cable].

As we reach for Project Gutenberg eBook #10,000. . .

Please help us reach more readers. . .send us email addresses
for anyone you know in the media. . .if no email address then
web addresses, snailmail, phone numbers, etc!!!

Thank you so much!  MUCH MORE IS BELOW!!!


*It Has Been Six Months Since Our Last Such Request Last Fall*

!!!Since that time we have moved from 6,000 eBooks to 7,650!!!


     And, WITH YOUR HELP, we want to try to make Project
     Gutenberg's eBook 10,000 by the end of this year!!!

We have 2 super-scanners in production, and they are hungry!
Help us find new books for scanning, and to proofread the
pages we already have scanned.

DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS NEEDS CONTENT

Thanks to very good recent publicity, the Distributed Proofreading
project has greatly accelerated its pace.   Please visit the site:
http://texts01.archive.org/dp for more information about how you
can help, even by scanning just one page per day.

If you have a book that has been scanned but have not yet run through
OCR (optical character recognition) please email pg@aldarondo.net
with information -- they'd be happy to work on it.

Also, DP is seeking public domain books not already in the
Project Gutenberg collection.  To see what is already online, visit
http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/GUTINDEX.ALL (a text file), since the
online database doesn't reflect recent additions.  Please email
charlz@lvcablemodem.com if you have books to send, or simply send them
(note that DP generally chops books to scan them, and usually does not
return scanned books).

Do you have Public Domain books your would like to see in the archive?
Can they be destructively scanned? If so send them to the Distributed
Proofreading Team!

We now also have this
new address in Chicago!

Please make sure that they are _not_ already in the archive and please check
them against David's In Progress list at

http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on them. It would also be helpful
if you clear them before mailing the books, send the 'OK' lines to

We ask you to keep an eye out at the garage sales & library sales
for inexpensive public domain books.

It was only 7 years ago that we managed our first 100 Etext year.
Our volunteers produced 2,650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
our next major goal is to reach 10,000 eBooks by the end of 2003!


Lots of important news for those who read all the way thru.


       We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer

         http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


   We Have Made It Much Easier To Donate [More Below]

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541
[Also sometimes referred to as a "federal tax id number."]

Currently we are in sort of a Catch-22 fundraising situation.
We are registered in most of the 50 states, with paperwork
in to get to all of them, but we don't have enough money
to reregister in all states. . .and the stack of paperwork
for these is literally as large as the person handling them.

The biggest part of this kind of Catch-22 situation is that
we are aware of at least one state that would fine us up to
$2,000 if we don't keep our registrations up to date.  You
can understand the terrible price we pay if we don't raise
enough money to even pay for all the legal paperwork and
registrations, we lose far more than what we might be able
to raise in that state.

The trustees of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
have told me that they have seen reputable reports that the cost
of complying with the laws of all 50 states runs approximately
$25,000 a year for small organizations and can go much higher
for larger organizations.  There are many fees associated with
compliance, such as renewal registration fees, the cost of an
audit by a CPA which some states require and fees for registered
agent services required in some states.

Obviously, we did the easiest and least expensive states first,
but some are the most difficult and expensive states are key states
with large populations that we need to reach.

None of our trustees have the time to do all this by themselves,
so we also have to pay for a 1/4 time assistant, even though our
trustees do serve pro bono.  Please note that we are in the process
of incorporating, so most Trustees will be on the Board of Directors.

We are unsure how states where we are not registered would view
appearances on national shows, such as Oprah, Regis, Letterman and Leno.
If they viewed these efforts as fundraising in their states, it could
cause serious problems.  So we are in even more of a Catch-22 than it
might appear at first, until we are registered in all 50 states,
and the District of Columbia.

We are expecting to have approximately 10,000 eBooks online by the
end of next year, with nearly 2,000 volunteers whom we would like
to provide more support for in the areas of copyright research,
book finding, scanning, proofreading, etc.  Currently every one
of the Project Gutenberg sites around the world is operated by
a volunteer who provides all the disk space, bandwidth, etc.,
and we would love to buy our own drives for at least the two
major US sites on which we initially post our eBooks.

***

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 501(c)(3)
organization with EIN [Employee Identification Number] 64-6221541,
and has been approved as a 501(c)(3) organization by the US Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).  Donations are tax-deductible to the maximum
extent permitted by law.  As the requirements for other states are met,
additions to this list will be made and fund raising will begin in the
additional states.


In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork
to legally request donations in all 50 states.  If
your state is not listed and you would like to know
if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in
states where we are not yet registered, we know
of no prohibition against accepting donations
from donors in these states who approach us with
an offer to donate.

***


First a few lines of comment on each of these topics,
then a more detailed explanation.


1.  Permanent

Unlike the usual character of the Internet and the World Wide Web,
television and radio, or most other modern media production outlets,
Project Gutenberg is a landmark. . .a permanent feature of the Net
. . .since before anyone had coined the term "Internet". . .since
before the World Wide Web. . .

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was founded to
ensure the continued existence and viability of our mission for
more decades, or even centuries into the future. . .with your help."

2.  Free

There are no hidden costs to use Project Gutenberg, no hardware
or software requirements. . .nearly every computer comes with a
wide variety of ways to receive, save, read and search our eBooks.


3.  Available

Project Gutenberg makes eBooks available in the easiest formats
to read, search, quote, etc. . .this is particularly important
to the visually impaired who use various programs to read aloud.

Contrary to the policies of most eBook operations, Project
Gutenberg encourages EVERYONE to download our eBooks and to
make them available to the public at large. . .worldwide,
with only a few words of warning not to violate local laws
concerning various copyrighted or trademarked materials we
include in our collection.  Most sites actively discourage
reposting of their files because they want all the hits.

Because of our unusual free access policy, volunteers have
created mirror sites in wide varieties of regions, including
every continent in the world, even Antarctica. . .to insure
everyone has easy access.  Within the last year or two, new
PG sites are up in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Hungary,
in addition to more sites in the United States and Canada.

"There is no end to the great things we can accomplish
if we don't worry about who gets the credit."  Anonymous

We don't care about getting the credit, we just want to
do the work.


4.  Useful

Students and scholars all over the world use Project Gutenberg
eBooks to search, research, and just plain read for fun.  As a
wider variety of screens become available, with an increasing
number of colors, more and more people are reading full books
on their computers, laptops, and palmtops.  In addition, Project
Gutenberg eBooks are wonderfully flexible for visually impaired
readers, and are easily readable by the text-to-speech software
used by many who cannot read at all.  More and more libraries
are now including Project Gutenberg eBooks in their collections.


5.  Enlightening

We are making a great effort to include every language we can
in our collection, and are hoping to include the classic books
from every culture within each language.  Project Gutenberg is
hoping to indeed be "A Window On The World."  We are hoping to
add a new language several times per year, so please make sure
we add something in YOUR language[s].


6.  Growing


We used to talk about Project Gutenberg as a kind of "book of the
month" production system. . .but now you would have to buy a whole
new bookshelf each and every month to hold all the paper editions
we present *OR* just add one new CDROM. . .hee hee!!!


7.  Yours

These books are yours, permanently. . . .

When you get a Project Gutenberg eBook, you have not checked it out,
licenced it, rented it, borrowed it, or any other temporary idiom.
You can quote them in any way you like, school papers, research,
books YOU may write. . .without limitation, other than on the 1%
of them that are copyrighted works, but you can still give those
away to anyone you like.

These books are YOURS. . .as many copies as you want. . .
any time you want. . .any place you want. . .
and they don't take up any space. . .
it's *literally* any *place* you want.

As a volunteer, these books are even more intimately yours, as we try
very hard to encourage our volunteers to do their own favorite books,
in their own languages, in their own good time. . .we don't put anyone
on a schedule. . . .


Here are the details. . . .


1.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Permanent.

The major difference between the products of Project Gutenberg
and those of other non-profit organizations such as PBS, NPR, etc.,
is that even now in its 32nd year, our original Etext of the U. S.
Declaration of Independence is downloaded by more people every year
than in any previous year of the history of the Internet.  When you
support Project Gutenberg, your support is seen permanently.  Your
contributions will be online for everyone to see from the moment of
the Newsletter announcements and will be listed in all the major
search engines and catalogs on the Internet.

You won't find TV showing all the shows from 30 years ago. . .but
the Project Gutenberg eBooks are there forever.  We update format
types from time to time, and correct errors, but when your family
reads any of our eBooks now, we want you to know you will be able
to find it again generations down the road.  We already have people
getting married and starting families of their own, who read Alice
from Project Gutenberg when they weren't even teenagers yet. . .and
their kids are growing up with the same traditions.

This is quite different from the way most Internet sites exist as a
day to day phenomenon, whereas we are planning on Project Gutenberg
eBooks being available as long as there IS an Internet.

When you buy CDROMs of most eBooks you get something that requires a
certain operating system, and even a certain version of it, usually
one that likely will be incompatible with the next version or the one
after that. . .and then you have to go out and buy another version.
That's where the big difference lies between Project Gutenberg eBook
and nearly every other kind you can get. . .you can still copy books
from Project Gutenberg onto your floppies, carry them to nearly any
computer, and read them with minimal effort, no installation needed.


2.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Free.

Because no installation is needed, these eBooks ARE free. . .there is
no particular brand of hardware or software you need to buy to read a
Project Gutenberg eBook. . .you don't even have to download a browser
. . .whether it is free or not. . . .  Virtually every computer there
is in the world can read these eBooks just the way it comes, and that
is the point of our existence. . . .

We want EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHEN to have free access to such a
library of classics in EVERY LANGUAGE.

7,650 Project Gutenberg titles are now available, and end users are
never charged a penny by Project Gutenberg for them.  All the eBooks
are done by our volunteers.  All the sites are run by volunteers.


3.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Available.

The Project Gutenberg eBooks are available from servers on all continents.
We hope to the number of servers will continually increase, and eventually
hope to have servers not just on every continent, but in every region,
and then in every country.  New sites are now in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
and several others.  With 3 billion computers already around the world,
and used ones available at garage sales for $5, pretty much anyone who
really wants to read eBooks and has electricity can do it.  I should add
that we are aware that 60% of the world's population has never made a
phone call. . .which is one reason we promote the giving away of our
eBooks on disks. . .we were receiving letters from around the world
from people who had received our eBooks on disk years before the
Internet actually circled the globe.

Our eBooks are actually available for download from several satellites.


4.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Useful.

Looking up something in any of our books takes less time that it would to
walk over to your own bookcase and find it in your own book.  Quoting the
material is even faster.  The Complete Works of Shakespeare could be used
for a search that would take literally seconds.  We also have very complete
editions of Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, so complete that
they have been listed in library journals as the most complete available
to the public in the entire world.  [I don't know if there are privately
owned collections that have more.  But the whole point is that anyone can
add our entire collection to theirs with no effort.]

We make our eBooks available in plain formats that virtually all programs
can read, quote, edit, search, etc.  Thus our readers use a wider variety
of computers and programs, at their own discretion, and budget, to read a
wide variety of eBooks.  This is a very important aspect of our work. . .
to make eBooks available to everyone. . .and to let them read it in their
own favorite programs, in their own favorite fonts, to search with search
engines of all varieties, not just those designed to parse through markup
systems of a particular variety.  We also provide conversions into markup
formats for many of these.  These are not trivially created by programmed
output only, but are the creations of days of work by our volunteers.  In
addition, the plain text versions are great for our blind readers who use
programs to read aloud to them.


5.  The Work of Project Gutenberg is Enlightening.

My hope is that the work of Project Gutenberg will finally allow access
to the information and literature of the entire world to the entire world.

"Of The People, By The People, For The People". . .says it pretty well.

Hopefully you will include yourself as one of "These People."


6.  Project Gutenberg Is Growing


Project Gutenberg is now producing 268 eBooks/month, 3200/year.
It was only 6 years ago that we managed our first 100 eBook year.
Our volunteers produced 2650 eBooks in the past 12 months, and
we hope reach a total of 10,000 as quickly as possible, perhaps
even by the end of this year, only 7 months from now. . . .

Not only is Project Gutenberg growing, but our audience is growing
as well, and even more quickly.  Our Sites Coordinator just told me
that half the people reading our books are new over the past 18 months.
This is not uncommon among brand new enterprises, but when you realize
this is our 32nd year, such growth is truly. . .no hyperbole. . . . .

PHENOMENAL!


Here is a brief history of our growth rate:

Here is brief timeline from the 1st Etext in 1971
to the current production of #7600.

1 per year in 1971-1979 completed the first 9 Etexts
which were mostly a "History of Western Democracy"

>From 1980-1990 the first Bible and Shakespeare were completed,
but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
still not able to be released.  Thus the total was 10 Etexts.
[Counting all of Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each.]
[This particular edition of Shakespeare is still copyrighted,
even now, 20 years later, due to TWO copyright extensions in
the 31 year history of Project Gutenberg, which have removed
two million books from the list we could put online.

eBooks per month per year

 1  in 1991 We released The Bible as #10.
 2  in 1992
 4  in 1993
 8  in 1994 We released The Complete Shakespeare as #100.
16  in 1995
32  in 1996
32  in 1997 [we lost our funding for that year, and barely survived]
36  in 1998 [kept this schedule for first half and then in second half
            we completed two months during each month for 72 per month]
36  in 1999 [is our official schedule, we are now about 8 months ahead,
            but, as luck would have it, on the day the muse struck to
            write this article, I learned that our funding is again lost.]
40  in 2000 [I was never personally comfortable doing over 30 per month,
50  in 2001 so this is when I started planning all the delegating of today]
100 in 2001 [Starting on our 30th Anniversay, and we thought we would NEVER
            be able to do this many, so it would bring us back on schedule,
            but so far, only three months later, we have. . .so who knows.]
            [Note added in January, 2002, we managed to do 1240 in 2001, so
            we did somehow manage to average 100 per month--who knows how.]
200 in 2002 We started 2002 with an incredible 200 eBooks per month,
            and managed to increase that to 203 by the end of the year.

300 in 2003 That's what we need, and are currently averaging about 268.


THAT'S WHY WE NEED ***YOU***!!!

Here are some highlights:

####  Date  Title

   1  1971  The U.S. Declaration of Independence [July 4, 1971]
  10  1990  The King James Bible
 100  1994  The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [December 10, 1993]
1000  1997  Dante's Divine Comedy, In Italian[September 1, 1997]
2000  1999  Don Quixote, In Spanish [April 23, 1999]
3000  2000  A L'Ombre Des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs V3 by Proust, In French
4000  2001  The Complete Works of "The French Immortals", In English
5000  2002  The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, In English [April 10, 2002]
6000  2002  Our First Polish eBook "Ironia Pozorow" [September, 2002]
7000  2003  January 31, and 7500 on March 29!

[Now that we can officially say we have "thousands" of these
eBooks online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more below]

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net/pg!!

[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers; we are ALL volunteers]

***

Do We Provide Access to A Trillion Dollars Of Etext Yet?!?!?

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 7,600 eBooks
to 1.6% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$1.31 as a street value of the average one of our books:
our population has passed 6.3 billion about the same time
we released Project Gutenberg eBook #7500.

Next year, as the population grows, this percentage should
fall into the 1.5x% range; and as the population should be
leveling out just before we reach 10 billion:  this figure
may never quite reach 1% = 100 million people.

OK. . .enough math. . .!!!

;-)

***

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of eBooks for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of Etext.

What about the original goal set 30 years ago?

This goal may have already been accomplished. . .though many
of the 20,000 files are still very much Limited Distribution
items, and we are hoping to see these posted in more places,
on more sites, for greater and greater public access.  These
will hopefully all be posted on Project Gutenberg sites some
time in the not too distant future, we are discussing this a
lot with the other eBook makers.  Creating a liaison between
all the eBook makers is one of our major goals right now.

There are currently over 20,000 eBooks listed in the indices
of the Internet Public Library, and, as usual between 20-25%
of them are from Project Gutenberg.

We should raise money to hire a copyright lawyer for this to
help us work on copyright research for many of the eBooks of
"unknown origin" that we can't republish yet.

***

If we are going to continue on past the first goal of 10,000 eBook
titles, then we are going to need some Big Time Public Relations--
and some Big Time fundraising. . .here's why. . . .

1.  Getting the eBooks to twice as many people is just as important
as creating twice as many eBooks. . .but without MAJOR publicity it
is not likely to happen. . .we constantly get messages from readers
who tell us they have been LOOKING for eBooks for years, but barely
now have FINALLY found Project Gutenberg.  This means we cannot get
to a major part of our audience with the kind of publicity we have,
we need something more. . . .  For example, we were the first in an
entirely new column:  "People To Watch" in TIME magazine, but there
were less than a dozen emails Project Gutenberg received from these
very kind words. . .what we really need is to get on Oprah Winfrey,
and hopefully add something to her book club.  Those of you on AOL,
perhaps you could email the show and request they invite us, and do
the same for Letterman, Leno, Rosie, Regis and all the others.

We should undoubtedly also try the other talk shows, and "magazine"
shows, etc.  All the press we receive is from them contacting us, I
have had no luck "generating" publicity. . .which seems to be easy,
for those who have the knack. . .it's just not MY knack. . .help!!!

We really need to find some Public Relations help!!!


2.  However, running this great group of volunteers to generate the
more than 2,500 new eBooks over the recently past eleven months has
been something that is a knack I have. . .and it hasn't cost a very
large amount of money to do this:  otherwise you wouldn't know that
we exist. . .BUT running a group of 10,000 volunteers to create the
1,000,000 eBooks that may possibly be a next step, will NOT be easy
--even for people with a knack for it.  It would require more phone
lines and/or calls than even the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation could presently afford. . .and more email than I can do,
on my own. . .SO we either need volunteers to help coordinate, or--
the possibility looms that we should actually HIRE people. . . .

Even if we have more volunteers to help, the Foundation needs to
actually hire some people to assure a basic level of continuous
coordination and support for volunteers, especially as the number
of volunteers increases.

When I first started Project Gutenberg in 1971, I was sure I should
be able to find someone else to replace me, as it did not cost real
money or take real time to run. . .but for the last 10 years it has
taken just about all the time I have, including what I would need a
lot more of to have a personal life. . .and I would LIKE to have an
expectation that Project Gutenberg would survive at least 10 years,
after I am gone, and hopefully 100, and if I really dream, 1,000!!!

So. . .if you are willing and able to help us with these or in some
related manner, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. . . .

The Distributed Proofreaders work in a variety of languages.

Also, we have just purchased and installed TWO new super-scanners
for the Distributed Proofreaders (http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg)
so we can scan more books.  We will also help with copyright research.

*

1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]
[We will do this even for people working on other eBook projects.]
[This can now be done by sending us scans as email attachments!!!]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

We will help you do the copyright research for your chosen books,
the laws are changing, perhaps even in the next few weeks, so I am
not including anything specific at the moment.  We try to keep lists
of copyright laws around the world, so please help us keep up to date
when you hear of any changes.

For more information on copyright, and to send us scans of
the title pages and versos of your books, please visit:
http://beryl.ils.unc.edu/copy.html


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you would like to help us make eBooks available in the future,
please contact the following:
Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
Brett Fishburne <william.fishburne@verizon.net>
Jim Tinsley <jtinsley@pobox.com>
with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


3.
Proofreading

We have a variety of ways for you to help with Project Gutenberg.

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on eBooks for
us is if they can ship their book to one of us, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

If you have a high-bandwidth server and would like to make
the Project Gutenberg collection available to people in your
region, please view details here:
        http://ibiblio.org/gutenberg/mirror-howto.txt

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare gigabytes on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.

Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations that must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Anything you can do in these states would be greatly appreciated,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our just released 7,500th eBook.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 300 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
eBooks for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having eBook archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for eBooks to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as eBooks, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

[It did pass.  October 27, 1998 - the U.S. went from life plus 50 to
life plus 70 for works created after 1/1/78, and from 75 to 95 years
for many works published before 1978. . .but this doesn't change the
items that had already entered the public domain in the US, unlike a
reversion from public domain status to copyright status in countries
in the European Union and other locales.  Thus, the US copyright for
most works still cuts in at 1923. . .and this is scheduled to stay a
cutoff date until around 2020.]

So the rule of thumb we use most is that anything pre-1923 is ok.


7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an eBook and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our eBooks,
we need some assistance in writing Perl scripts, sh scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough eBook version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

More Detailed Information

1.
Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

Since Project Gutenberg began in 1971, millions of copyrights in
the US should have expired, but have been prevented from expiring
by various political action groups.



2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs work best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
others do better on other fonts, page coloration, etc.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most eBook providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an eBook
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg eBooks are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of eBooks prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
eBook enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new eBook with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of eBooks, many of which have vastly more errors than in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial eBooks.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg eBooks is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
eBook or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.


More on:

Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
Word's "compare" that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our eBooks, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror eBooks should not suffer any.

Remember:
Some local research is required to find out what copyright laws and
other regulations must be satisfied to operate such servers.


5.
Donations

Because of the type of tax exempt organization that the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation falls within, it is especially
important that our financial support come from as wide a base as possible.
So far, we have not received any local, regional or national grants,
but when we do obtain such funding, it will be even more important to
maintain broad public support as well.  To maintain our tax exempt status,
between 10% and 34% of our financial support must come from the public.

You are the backbone of our support.

We could barely survive otherwise.


6.
Raiders of the Lost Archives

We need people who can help us save eBooks that have been put online,
but without enough information to verify they are out of copyright.
This usually is done by comparing the first and last pages of each
chapter to a paper edition we can be sure is out of copyright.

If you can either help us find these eBooks, or their counterparts in
pre-1923 paper editions, you can help preserve these eBooks online,
otherwise they will are eventually likely to be deleted.

A Personal Note From The Founder


It's a bit ironic that last week we
announced eBook #9,000 and now this
week we have to announce that we do
not have enough money to survive 93
days that it should take to put out
our 10,000th eBook. . . .



Here Are The TOP 10 Ways To Help:

[Please don't hesitate to think of
more ways than these. . . .]


1.  Music

2.  Artwork

3.  Movies

4.  Poetry

5.  More Languages

6.  We Are Broke, Not That We Ever Aren't But. . .

7.  PR, Media, Advertising, Contacts, Shmoozing

8.  Progress Graphs and Statistics

9.  Help With PT1 Of The Newsletter

10. Reaching 15% Of The World Population


***

1.  Music

I would like to see Project Gutenberg provide a MIDI file score
[Musical Instrument Digital Interface] for all musical classics
from Beethoven, Back and Brahms to Tschaikowsky, Stravinsky and
Rachmaninoff; from Gregorian chants to the start of the Roaring
Twenties, and everything we can find in between.

Why?

Because I want every person in the future to be able to work on
conducting an entire orchestra, an orchestra that never misses,
notes or timing, piannissimo to fortissimo, allegro to minuet.

I would like to see people become literate in the musical sense
in same way we are helping people in the more traditional ways.

Someday I would like to see someone who has never even seen the
orchestra come in and lay down their score and say:

_I_ think Beethoven should be played THIS WAY!

Does anyone remember Bruno Martelli from FAME ?



2.  Artwork

As above, I should like every person to have access to pictures
of all the great historical paintings, sculptures, mosaics, etc.

I would like to see people become literate in the artistic sense
in same way we are helping people in the more traditional ways.

Someday I would like to see someone who has never even seen the
artworks come in and lay down their work and say:

_I_ think another Impressionist might have painted THIS WAY!



3.  Movies

This is a particularly tough one for two reasons:

A.  The bandwidth is high

B.  Copyright

We need someone to interface with archive.org's movie people,
and more. . . .



4.  More Languages

As the Internet has reached the majority of the countries of
the world, and we seek to increase our readership from 1.5%
of the world population to 15%, we should work harder and
harder to include as many languages as we can.

This should include original books, translations, and the
translation of our web pages into more languages.



5.  We Are Broke, Not That We Ever Aren't, But. . .

Irony:  As Project Gutenberg moves from 9,000 to 10,000
eBooks in the next 4 months, we only have 2 months' budget
on hand. . .so right now it looks as if we will run out of
money in October. . . .

This month my assistant and I are working with no salary.
We might get paid later, if things start looking up.

We are going to need people to interface with the MAJOR
granting agencies to get a good run a million eBooks!!!

We should approach the Fortune 500, Computer 100, and
the 500 wealthiest people, too.

Can YOU help???



6.  PR, Media, Advertising, Contacts, Shmoozing

Obviously, if we are to increase our readership from 1.5%
to 15% of the world population, we are not going to be
able to rely on the mostly word of mouth public relations
that have taken us this far.  Even if we DO manage to get
to 1,000,000 eBooks, we won't be able to get them to 15%
of the world's population without some serious help. . .
not only to deliver them when people ask for them. . .but
just to let them know these books are available,

We need to find some people who can help us break through
the surface tension of the media world and help us give a
million eBooks to the audience of some television shows:
Leno, Letterman, Oprah, Regis, etc., etc., etc.

The funny part, of course, is that if we had been able to
charge even one cent per eBook, at a trillion of them, we
would have made 10 billion dollars, and THEY would be in
line trying to see US, rather than the other way around.

I always think that is SO totally ironic. . . .

We need YOUR help here!!!



7.  Progress Graphs and Statistics

We need something with some visual impact to use in our Press Kit.

I've mentioned that printed books containing the Project Gutenberg library
would weigh as much as the average elephant, but in another year we won't
be able to find ANY elephant that weighs enough to balance them, so we are
going to need some new ways to demonstrate how many eBooks there are.


I have these little graphs like this one:

For now:

But we need something to emphasize that if you printed out all the Project
Gutenberg eBooks in normal hardback format, not computer paper, they would
STILL weigh 10,000 pounds = 5 tons = weight of the average adult elephant!

And something about how this same graph will get us to 1,000,000 eBooks in
just one more decade.

It's going to take some imagination to come up with these!!!



8.  Help With PT1 Of The Newsletter

I'm going to be concentrating much more on PR and fundraising,
and I have serious tunnel-vision. . .I need help so I won't be
distracted from helping us achieve our goals for the new decade.



9.  Reaching 15% Of The World Population:  not PR.

Not only are we going to need PR to just TELL people 1,000,000
eBooks are available in 100 different languages, but we should
be preparing some people who know how to help when people want
to set up servers in various locations and languages. . . .

Greg Newby, among all the other dozens of hats he wears for us
. . .is also our Mirror Guru. . .and will certainly be able to
use some help. . .especially when we run into other languages,
operating systems, and other variables.

I should also add that we've never had enough money to pay him
a single cent. . . .


In just a few years, literally, English will no longer be what
it has been, the dominant language of the Internet, and then a
few more years and it won't even be second. . . .

If we are indeed going to prepare for the next 10 years we are
going to have to surf the new waves as they come along. . . .


Which brings us to:



10.  Planning For The Next Decade, And Beyond

There are obviously events, and approaches, that no one single
person can possibly come up with, so we are going to need some
SERIOUS futurist thinking and analysis. . .all ideas should be
considered. . . .



For music & art & languages & PR & etc. we'd like to get
a team together.  We can provide, free of charge, titles
such as PR coordinator, or music curator.  We can set up
mailing lists, provide guidance and solicit even further
help from our Newsletter and Web pages.  Be a leader, or
be a follower, for a few minutes per month to many hours
per day.  Consider, what it would take for YOU to become
more involved. . .then we'll help to make it happen!!!



Thanks!!!

Always so nice to hear from you!

As of August 19 we are over 9/10 of the way to 10,000 eBooks!!!:

Your download should include ~9075+ free eBooks from Project Gutenberg at:

http://gutenberg.net

That means there are ~925- left to go until we get to #10,000!

Currently we have ~110 days to go to December 10, 2003,
a decade since eBook #100, and are averaging 10+ per day.


Next week, hopefully about 70 more!

We are currently running at about 96% of Moore's Law growth.
Perhaps YOUR contribution will bring us up to 100%!!!

Please send us your suggestions!

Hand out free copies!
Today Project Gutenberg is over 1/4 of the way from 10,000 eBooks to 20,000 !


Contrary to all the pundits' prolific predictions over the years,
Project Gutenberg not only has not gone under, but has continued
it's growth on a curve in excess of Moore's Law, as in this graph:

We should also add that the quality of the Project Gutenberg eBooks has been
increasing over the same period; in terms of initial accuracy, format options
and continuous error correction.  In addition, Project Gutenberg now provides
eBooks in 31 languages, with Project Gutenberg of Europe targeting over 50.

The 30th language at Project Gutenberg was Romanian.

Project Gutenberg of Australia has already released 350 eBooks.

Project Gutenbergs of Canada and Luxembourg are opening soon, with new
entries from all the European Union nations expected in the near future.

If the growth rate listed above continues for only one more decade,
Project Gutenberg will be offering over one million books in 2012,
and the next step will be to translate these million eBooks into
100 different languages.

By the time this is all complete, perhaps by Project Gutenberg's
50th Anniversary in 2021, we hope to provide 10 million eBooks
from all over the world, and present them in 100 languages,
for a total 1 billion eBooks, and we hope to distribute these
to 1 billion readers, 15% of the world population.

If we succeed, we will give away one quintillion eBooks.

At present, even if we have only reached just over 1% of the world,
we have already given away over a trillion eBooks.DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS UPDATE - OCTOBER 19, 2004

THE 5,000th TITLE COLECTION - OCTOBER 2004

by Thierry Alberto



"I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library."

--Jorge Luis Borges


On the morning of October 8, 2004, near his library window overlooking a
quiet lake in upstate New York, David Widger ran a series of final checks
and verifications on a partitioned element of the 11th edition of the
Encyclopedia Britannica.  Yes, that same EB11 which has long been known as
a formidable processing challenge throughout the Project Gutenberg
community.  This latest approach towards its digital conversion did little
to diminish that reputation.  It was about to do something of great
importance, however.  Dr. Widger had been anticipating the project files
for some 48 hours by the time they were at last wrestled into acceptable
compliance.

For everyone aware of what was on the Whitewashing agenda that morning, an
intermingled sense of relief and excitement began to spread.  This "slice"
of EB11 was not simply another single project being posted to the PG
shelves, but the final component in a varied and impressive collection
which had been in preparation for several months.  When the final checks
were cleared, the Britannica text joined 50 other finished works as a
single commemorative event organized to mark the completion of Distributed
Proofreaders' 5,000th unique title produced for Project Gutenberg and the
digital public domain.

This event is the largest single contribution to Project Gutenberg in the
four year history of Distributed Proofreaders.   Through the orchestrated
collective efforts of its members throughout the world, DP produced 50
diverse and significant written works to accompany the 5,000th title on its
journey to the PG library.  A total of over 13,000 original pages from a
distinctive variety of books in several languages were carefully chosen to
display the merits and strengths of the DP production model.  A sister
objective for this collection was to produce a newsworthy example of the
fertility of public domain content yet to be converted into digital
formats.

In our own "Field of Dreams," we have learned collectively, that if we
build it ... they will definitely come.  What we do not know yet, is how
strongly "they" and others to come will defend what we are building, should
the public domain be challenged further.  At the heart of the inspiration
for this Collection is a belief that we can help insure that present and
future volunteers will care enough to stand up should they be called to.
If we make a dramatic and valid statement now and then, proving what a
fertile field this really is, we may indeed embolden many to care and
nurture these legacy resources.


"All that Mankind has done, thought, gained or been--it is lying as in
magic preservation in the pages of Books."

--Thomas Carlyle


These 51 projects have much in common that binds them together as a family
with a focused intention.  In one manner or other, all of these titles
belong to a larger set of projects, some of them so vast that it will
require several years to complete them. The titles within the collection
were selected from amongst its most challenging and complex projects in
order to demonstrate the varied strengths of the Distributed Proofreaders
production model.

There are four classes of super or "uber" projects which make up the 5,000
Collection. These are:

1) 'Classic Ubers' - Truly massive works such as EB11 or the Bureau of
American Ethnology reports, spanning over thirty years.

2) 'Large Book Sets' - Smaller in scale than the Classic Ubers, yet still
daunting enough to discourage commencement by an individual.  Among this
class are Hakluyt's 'Principal Voyages of the English Nation', 'The
Psychology of Sex' by Havelock Ellis and 'The Library of the World's Best
Literature.'

3) 'Author Collections' - Organized programs to provide entire libraries of
an author's work for Project Gutenberg, or to complete catalogs of authors
partially represented.  The intention with these sets is to systematically
advance PG towards comprehensive coverage of commonly requested authors
with works in the public domain.  Featured authors include: Hendrik
Conscience, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Edward Lear and George Sand.

4) 'Periodicals'  -  As a whole, the processing of entire runs of many
volumes of journal titles is perhaps the largest initiative DP has ever
undertaken.  Among the many periodicals represented within the 5K
Collection are: 'The Atlantic Monthly', 'Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine',
'Notes and Queries', 'Punch', and 'Scientific American.'

The accomplishment represented by the 5,000 milestone is a source of great
pride to the membership of DP.   Fueling the labor of our intentions for
the 5K Collection was a desire to produce for the world a gift of immense
value that would dramatically exemplify the best of which Distributed
Proofreaders is now capable. Read through the manifest at the end of this
newsletter and see if that wealth of titles does not stir up a sense of
profound excitement about the work we are all engaged in here.  There is a
fine hope which we are capable of encouraging together with our dedication.
Intending towards a greater good for the world with our industrious
energies, we become a living example of what is possible when like-minded
people join together in creative endeavor.  It is a rare example, true ...
but it is powerful ... and so greatly needed within this time of deep and
uncertain change. Faith in a brighter future is an essential source of
courage and stability.  Preserving history and cultural legacies of the
past sustains that faith by providing recognition of the continuity of the
human story across time and change.  This is not the day to day reason for
why we preserve public domain works, yet it is a subtle, derivative effect
of what we do.


"For books are more than books, they are the life, the very heart and core
of ages past, the reason why men lived and worked and died, the essence and
quintessence of their lives."

--Amy Lowell


5,000 unique written works.  As accustomed as many of us have become to the
steady accomplishments of the Project Gutenberg community, being book
lovers, we are still capable of being awed by our milestones.   5,000
published works is a vast library by the measure of any human lifetime.
To secure such an archive in print form would cost a fortune, the likes of
which few of us will ever amass.  Yet here they all are! ... available to
anyone in the world with access to the Internet; and now to some even
without such access.  We are not talking about just any books we can lay
our hands on.   Amongst these 5,000 titles are a large number of creative
works that are treasured among the great legacies of world culture.  In
organizing the choices for this collection, it was decided from the
beginning to emphasize the value of content within the public domain which
has yet to be converted into digital formats.  This has been successfully
achieved through the inclusion of exemplary representatives of such written
treasures.

Having been closely involved with the previous milestone celebrations, I
can avow that these rituals mean much more to the members of DP than
crowing over past accomplishments.  What we each derive from these
celebrations has more to do with inspiration than anything else.  When we
pause in our daily efforts at DP to commemorate the rounded figures of
Golden projects, posted to PG, what we experience is a refreshed
recognition of why it was that we came to devote our time and energy to
this cause in the first place.   These are times when we reflect on how far
we have each come, the projects we have been involved with and what we have
learned.  At these times we remember (or blissfully forget) the various
challenges we have passed through along the way and we share all these
recollections and reflections with people who have grown to become our
friends, even though continents may lay between us.  There is always a
renewed sense of energy and commitment after each celebration, and this
time the inspiration is more deeply felt than ever before.  The reasons for
this are as varied as the individuals who make up the DP membership. In
this past week, I have received a wondrous outpouring of distinctive
expressions from people involved in all fields of project production.  One
common feeling that I have been noticing is joy.  It is a joy that comes
from participating in something greater than oneself, which is at the same
time intimately familiar and personally valued.  This is a deeply felt and
powerful emotion experienced by many involved in this field of work.  Yet,
all we are doing here is crafting some old, dusty tomes into e-texts.
Right?


"Read, read, read."

--William Faulkner


It is just four years now since Charles Franks put forth an innovative idea
for how to enhance the development process of public domain texts for
Project Gutenberg.  It is not at all uncommon for someone to pull down a
good or even brilliant idea from wherever it is that spirit of invention
springs.  What is very uncommon is for someone to take a great idea and
follow through upon it across the forge of trial and error unto eventual
success. Project Gutenberg is an impressive example of what can happen in
this world when one individual does pass through the crucible of creative
innovation to see an idea crafted into manifest utility.  Sometimes the
hardest challenge while bringing a new idea into existence is rallying
enough supporters to your cause.  An idea in and of itself will not do the
work for you.  Action must be taken and the validity of the idea must be
proven, if others are to ally themselves with the values and intentions
underlying the idea.  The positive effects of Michael Hart's contribution
to our age will continue on well into the lives of generations to come.  We
may not be able to measure the full extent of  Project Gutenberg's benefit,
but we none the less know it is extensive, world spanning and long lasting.
What Charles and the early circle of DP members proved, was that
inspirational lightning could definitely strike the same ground twice.

It took a while and a lot of puzzle work to figure out how best to
implement those early concepts of distribution, but in time they were well
worked out.  As with most productive endeavors, we can measure the success
of DP by the quality and growth of its expressive output.  Both of these
measures have been improving at a steadily impressive rate over the past
three years, from about the time the foundational process of DP was settled
upon.  For quality, I offer that you merely spend some time with any number
of the texts within this collection.  Let the work convey its own merit to
you, in ways I could never hope to match.   For the quantity measure, we
can look to the primary indicator of growth at DP ... the number of pages
being proofed each day.

By the middle of 2001, with the basic production models in use, the daily
average of pages proofed was 259.  One year later that figure had nearly
quadrupled to an average of 1001 pages per day.  Step forward two more
years, to the present, and DP is averaging in the neighborhood of 6,000
pages proofed on a daily basis.  Of course this measure alone does not come
near to conveying the advances of all the production processes involved in
the creation of finished texts at DP.  It is merely a single snapshot
...yet one that captures a clear sense of how successful the distributed
model has proved to be.

Another new and dramatic measure which became evident in 2004, is the
broadening interest in adapting the DP model to other archival projects.
The most advanced of these at present is Distributed Proofreaders Europe,
initiated and maintained by the Rastko family of archives and cultural
initiatives based in Belgrade.  The European DP will provide support for
Project Gutenberg Europe which is soon to begin its official testing phase.
PG Europe will expand what is available online in the public domain
according to European copyright terms.

What the future holds for DP seems bright with promise in many directions,
and it is to the future, more than anywhere else, that we are turning our
attention this month.


"The oldest books are still only just out to those who have not read them."

--Samuel Butler


The significance of the public domain edition of Encyclopedia Britannica
and the broad based interest in its development, led to its selection as a
milestone project for DP. While EB's 11th edition easily meets the
classification as one of the most complex of DP's multi-volume projects,
its selection was also influenced by future possibilities. By giving the
Britannica project spotlighted prominence as the 5,000th title during
ongoing promotions, we will also be drawing attention to the need for new
waves of volunteers to assist in its eventual completion.  This is true for
most of the projects within the 5K Collection.  Some of the book sets and
periodical titles are nearing completion, a few are even completed.  These
will serve as inspiration ... impressive examples of the significant work
which people can participate in.  For the most part however, the complex
projects represented in the collection have a long way to go before they
are entirely available from the PG shelves.  The ongoing promotional work
beginning this month with the 5,000th title, shall carry forward through
the end of the year, reaching out to new generations of volunteers, who
will see these vast works through to the final page.

It is for these future generations of volunteers that the second exhibition
of the 5,000 Collection was conceived.  Yes ... a second exhibition.  After
providing everyone, including myself some time to recuperate from the
preparations of the First Collection, the Second Collection is now in
production.  The aim of this follow through pageant is to sustain the
messages of the 5,000 Collection while providing a dynamic demonstration of
DP's production capabilities.  The presentation of this broad selection of
complex projects was an organized event, yet it was not an extraordinary
exercise spent for the sake of promotional theatrics.  Processing large
scale, complex projects is part of DP's daily stock & trade.  Because the
labor is broadly distributed, we often lose sight of the scale of what is
being accomplished over time.  The purpose of extending the presentation of
the 5K Collection is to provide a stage upon which the present strengths of
the DP model can be substantiated.

The Second Collection is timed to coincide with the end of the month.  The
actual date of posting will depend upon the reluctance of those few
projects who may shy away from their initial public premiere.   Among the
featured titles will be several additional volumes or periodical issues
appearing in the First Collection as well as some projects more complex, in
their own way, then any among the initial 50.  If the Fates are kind, we
expect to deliver another portion of EB11. With what we have been learning
from these first two partitions, we do expect to soon witness a steady
stream of 11th Edition "slices" making their way to PG. Once each volume
has been completed, a single file matching the original print edition will
be compiled.

An original content feature is being crafted as a supportive initiative to
the 5,000 events. Background information about each project is being
gathered and prepared to form a permanent resource for public access.
These articles will explore the history of each work and its author,
augmented by a chronicle of the project's development at DP.  In time,
other features will join the project backgrounds to form an evolving news
and information center at DP.  Among other content being developed for the
center are articles documenting the history and lore of DP's evolution, a
variety of community resources, support for new visitors and timely
coverage of current events.  Watch for announcements on the main page at DP
regarding the progress of the news and information center.


"Books--the children of the brain."

--Jonathan Swift


It is a little over a week now since the First Collection posted to PG.  In
that time, over 100 titles have followed after those 51 and turned to Gold.
As we turn our attention to the labors of the Second Collection and move on
towards the future, we carry with us a happy certainty: wherever that
future takes us, there will be plenty to read when we get there.

With an initiative of this scale it is difficult in the space allowed to
fairly credit each person who participated.  Once the second collection is
complete we will compose a roll of all those involved and post it in a very
public place at DP.  At present, I want to express a deep sense of
gratitude to three volunteers on the PG side who deserve noted recognition.
Well in advance of posting the first collection David Widger, Jim Tinsley
and Joseph Lowenstein began working in close coordination with us.
Performing like great chefs over a two week period, the Whitewashing team
orchestrated all 51 projects into organized assembly.  Presenting these
works as a cohesive collection would not have been possible without their
advice and dedication.

To everyone who made the 5,000 Milestone a reality ... one page at a time
... Congratulations! I look forward to reporting on all the future
milestones yet to be realized as we continue the labor begun by Michael
Hart of building the world's grandest library.

For now.

Thierry


"Books, books, books had found the secret of a garret-room piled high with
cases in my father's name; Piled high, packed large,--where, creeping in
and out among the giant fossils of my past, like some small nimble mouse
between the ribs of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there at this or that
box, pulling through the gap, in heats of terror, haste, victorious joy,
the first book first.  And how I felt it beat under my pillow, in the
morning's dark. An hour before the sun would let me read! My books!"

--Elizabeth Barrett Browning

I will be sending out several announcements today
about the new Project Gutenberg Consortia Center.

The first few will be extremely brief, while some
that follow should answer questions you may have.

The site answers to 3 domain names, just pick the
the one you like the most:

pgcc.net
gutenberg.cc
gutenberg.us


There are approximately 37,000 files available on
this site, 27,000 of these are HTML files, with a
variety of other formats also included.  The HTML
files should be easily accessible from the search
engine, please let us know of any that are not in
the search engine, graciously loaned to us.  This
search engine is currently being modified to make
it specify it searches Project Gutenberg eBooks.

Another 10,000 or so files are accessible through
a variety of links to sites provided by donors of
the various eBooks.

These eBooks are catalogued as per the preference
of those who donated them, most with one entry to
each book, but many are listed by chapter, and in
some particular cases, even by page, as per those
who donated them.

Please let us know by reply to this email, and to

info@gutenberg.cc

of any ways we can improve your access.

On request, I will provide a single email with an

Press release:


THE FIRST PROJECT GUTENBERG CONSORTIUM CENTER IS OPEN!!!


November 4, 2004


Today, on the one-third of a century anniversary date of
Project Gutenberg, it is my pleasure to announce a site
designed for the exchange of entire eBook collections--

The first of the Project Gutenberg Consortia Centers is
located at a site designated by its initials:  pgcc.net

The mission of the Project Gutenberg Consortia Centers:
to help people legally exchange eBook collections under
the various new copyright laws.

As you may know, different countries had copyright laws
change drastically over the last few years, and we hear
even more changes are coming at the end of this year.

Therefore, we are making this effort to help those whom
these copyright extensions will effect, to insure their
continued abilities to provide free eBooks within rules
of their new copyright laws; such as many EU countries,
and apparently Australia at the end of this year, along
with various other changes we will try to help everyone
keep up with.

We hope to be making similar announcements next year to
let you know about more such sites under the laws of an
assortment of countries worldwide.

34 Years of Project Gutenberg


A Trillion eBooks Given Away !!!

If our average eBook has reached only 1% of the world population of
6,451,809,157 that would be 16,621 x 64,518,092 = 1.07 Trillion !!!


July 4, 2005 marks the completion of the 34th year of
Project Gutenberg and the beginning of our 35th year.


Here is a very brief review of our current projects:
[More information available on request]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


The original Distributed Proofreaders have now created
over 7,000 eBooks and you can volunteer to proofread 1
page or 100 pages or 1,000 at:     http://www.pgdp.net


At this moment the initial Project Gutenberg site has
progressed about 2/3 of the way from 10,000 to 20,000
cataloged items in a range of about 45 languages.

http://www.gutenberg.org

By July 4, 2006 this total should be at 20,000 items.


This total includes nearly 500 entries out of Project
Gutenberg of Australia.       http://gutenberg.net.au


104 languages are included with the Project Gutenberg
Consortia Center.             http://www.gutenberg.cc


In addition Project Gutenberg of Canada is beginning,

Please email:
pgcanada@lists.pglaf.org

To subscribe to the pgcanada list, please visit:
http://lists.pglaf.org/listinfo.cgi/pgcanada


Project Gutenberg efforts are also starting to get on
track in Portugal and The Philippines.


We would like to take this opportunity to give thanks
to our major download site at ibiblio.org operated at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where
over a million eBooks per month have been downloaded,
month after month, year after year.


A year from now we hope you might be able to download
50,000 items via the combined Project Gutenberg sites.

*


  Not Just Downloads, We Also Hand Out Physical Media


In addition, we are working on The Million Dollar DVD
of which the current prototype contains nearly 26,000
eBooks, and is about 3/4 full.  With those additional
books we can add in the last 1/4, plus compression of
a better variety, we are hoping to put perhaps 40,000
eBooks on one single-sided single-layered DVD that we
can encourage people to copy onto $1 blanks.

Using about 1/3 of the current average hardback price
of ~$75, we can easily count these 40,000 eBooks with
the value as $1,000,000.

Of course, if you wanted to use "list price" then you
could say it was "The Three Million Dollar DVD" {TM}.

In addition, just a week ago we received our test DVD
for our first double-layered version, which would let
us put twice as much on a single disc, and now at the
same price per layer as the previous versions.  These
advances will likely continue until we are able to do
a double-sided double-layered DVD containing 155,000,
which means that you get a million dollar total value
using per book price less than the average paperback,
along with a searchable catalog.


Last week we gave away 10,000,000 eBooks in Alaska to
give a boost to the eBook program of Alaska's Library
Association, the University of Alaska, and many other
participants in our presentations there.

We donated a DVD containing 5,000 eBooks to every one
of the Alaska Library Association member libraries!!!

We are hoping to do such projects in North Dakota and
other far regions, as well as everywhere else we will
be asked.

Just let us know if you are interested.


These are some of the dreams of Project Gutenberg and
we would LOVE to include your goals in our projects.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has
received official non-profit 501(c)(3) status via the

But the human-read ones [audio-books] are rather good. I've been using
them to help my Taiwanese wife improve English. She's a big Sherlock
Holmes fan. To be able to listen to a well-read audio book, whilst
reading both the English and Mandarin versions of the text has
helped her considerably. I now fear that her English is becoming
a tad Victorian though. I actually found her saying "Let us make
haste to the pub." And she thinks it terribly funny to call me Watson.

Dear Mr. Hart,
This is just a short note to personally say "Thank you" for
initiating the Gutenberg project.
Sincerely,
Richard Kelly


you're a genius

I only wish the Bible were as perfect as eBooks from GP.





This is just a short note to personally say
Thank you" for the Gutenberg project.


Let me thank you for making Project Gutenberg a reality.
I've enjoyed it for many years.


". . .just downloaded [Aristotle's `Ethics.'  Again, thank
you much for all the work that has gone into your site."


Thank you for Project Gutenberg which is really an amazing resource.


Project Gutenberg is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen.
Thanks to all of the volunteers, for this great service to humanity.



Subject: Just a 'Thank You' for Gutenberg...

Hello!
The Subject Line says it all...

Just a 'Thank You' from someone who (if it wasn't for this project)
would never have read a Shakespeare Sonnet.


I'm fairly certain I would never have solved the mystery without your
"Project Gutenberg" publication. I still have no idea what I'm going to
do with this old book, but finding out its "story" has been fascinating.




I'm incredibly grateful for your vision and for PG,
and I'm an active and prolific contributor to PG
through Distributed Proofreaders.


Good day to you and to all those that are out there making
sure some of us, especially me, benefit from Project Gutenburg.
[from Nigeria]


I hope that this donation will help your work.
Many thanks for your site - it is a treat and
I am very pleased to have found it.


Thank you so much for your work. This is so great.


THANK YOU for all the efforts you've poured in, and all the
sacrifices you've made in making Project Gutenberg a reality.


I truly admire the accomplishments and goals of Project Gutenberg.


Thank you. It's very difficult to have books sent to where I am.
I'm grateful to be able to access them on the website!  [From Iraq]


Thanks for Gutenberg!


Keep up your heroic effort!


You are my heroes.  Thank you for all you have accomplished!


It is a great pleasure for me to share all the Best of Gutenberg (with its
unidentified "errors") with my family, friends and associates.  I use the
CDs as my business cards to spread the word about great literature.


I have just down loaded some books from the *here goes,*
Gutenburg section of the online access for we the blind.
Now I'm looking around to see if I can find these very
interesting books of which I will thouroughly enjoy I expect.
Again, much thanks.

At any rate I have signed up to be a proofreader and
commend you for the giant you have all created.

[Funny, _I_ always thought of PG as tilting at the
giants out there.  If we have become a giant it is
only through your help!]

Please allow me to add my own thanks to this list,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0509130841060.30533@pglaf.org>


I am considering cutting PT1 into two sections, PT1A and PT1B,
as several people have suggested that the new portions should
be presented in one place, while the repetitive portions will
be presented separately.

Right now I have placed markers that say:

***BREAK FOR PT1A AND PT1B***

where such a break would take place, with perhaps a bit of an
adustment to take place after a few tries to get everything a
bit more sorted out for the new format.

Your comments are requested.

                  CHEAP PORTABLE TERABYTES


Every Word In The Library Of Congress In A $100-$150 DVD Notebook?


It's possible.


Less than 24 hours ago I bought a couple notebooks at Fry's
that hold 200 and 320 CDs and/or DVDs respectively with one
of the Project Gutenberg Directors.

On the way home he calculated just how much data we will be
able to put in these notebooks.

Based on a 4.3G standard storage rate, and a 10.25G zipped,
with zip operating at about 59% compression you will now be
able to carry data as follows:


For ~$88:

200 DVDs    Standard       200 x  4.3G =  .86 Terabytes
200 DVDs    Zipped Text    200 x 10.25 = 2.05 Terabytes


For ~$140

320 DVDs    Standard       320 x  4.3G = 1.376 Terabytes
320 DVDs    Zipped Text    320 x 10.25 = 3.28 Terabytes


At a cost of two for a dollar, 200 DVDs would cost $100
At a cost of three for a dollar, 200 DVDs would cost $67

At a cost of two for a dollar, 320 DVDs would cost $160
At a cost of three for a dollar, 320 DVDs would cost $107


The actual retail prices we paid is between at $.39 each,
or about 2.5 DVDs per dollar.

$.39 per DVD
$10 for the #200 notebooks
$15 for the #320 notebooks
$78 for 200 DVDs
$125 for 320 DVDs

Thus a notebook full of 200 DVDs costs $78 + $10 = $88

Thus a notebook full of 320 DVDs costs $125 + $15 = $140 today,
and could probably hold every plain text eBook that will be out
from all the various eBook projects combined for who knows just
how many years.

However, by the time you manage to fill such a notebook you can
be sure something will be available that will let you carry two
or three times as much just as easily and inexpensively.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0511071200480.11221@pglaf.org>


*Project Gutenberg of Australia Celebrates the Posting of Its 500th ebook*


In a joint issue with Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org/),
Project Gutenberg of Australia (http://gutenberg.net.au) is
celebrating the release of its 500th ebook,

'The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea' by George Collingridge.

The accumulation of 500 freely available ebooks since the inception
of Project Gutenberg of Australia in August 2001 represents the work
of many volunteers.

There are, of course, other books on Australian History but the present
title is an appropriate one to mark the release our 500th ebook as 2006 is
the 400th anniversary of the beginning of Australia's documented history.
In 1606 Willem Janszoon (aka Jansz.) charted some of the west coast of
the Cape York Peninsula and made the first authenticated landing on
Australian soil.

A number of events are being organised to commemorate the occasion by
"Australia on the Map: 1606-2006" (http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/).

Collingridge's book narrates the Portuguese and Spanish discoveries in the
Australasian regions, between the years 1492-1606, with descriptions of
their old charts.

The work of Project Gutenberg in providing free ebooks is well known.
Less appreciated sometimes is the role it plays in preserving books
which might otherwise be "lost" and in making available titles which
it would not be commercially viable to republish. 'The First Discovery
of Australia and New Guinea' has, of course, been superseded by works
which have the advantage of later research. However, it is often desirable
to be able to read history from the perspective of earlier historians.

'The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea' by George Collingridge
may be found at both Project Gutenberg and Project Gutenberg of Australia.

http://www.gutenberg.org
and
http://gutenberg.net.au

***

The official title of the book is:

THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA
(Being The Narrative of Portuguese and Spanish Discoveries
in the Australasian Regions, between the Years 1492-1606,
with Descriptions of their Old Charts, by George Collingridge)

Huge thanks and congratulations to all the PGAu volunteers!!!

Next Wednesday is the last Wednesday before I leave to give a
presentation in Alaska followed by a month's working vacation.

I can usually help quite a bit while I am on the road, but it
is harder when I don't have the usual tools at hand, and I am
unable to do all kinds of cutting and pasting as usual.

A few alternatives:

We could only do the PT2 automated Newsletter.

We could do a very short weekly Newsletter for that month.

We could try to do something as long as usual, with help.

Any suggestions or volunteers?

Thanks!!!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0606081311560.29445@pglaf.org>


As most of you are aware, it is 4 weeks until we complete our
35th year of Project Gutenberg history, and we have about 380
eBooks left to make it to 20,000.

This would be about 95 per week. . .we did 82 this week.

So it's not such a Big Push as we did to get to 10,000, but a
rather smaller push, which is why you haven't heard me say an
awfully lot about it. . .things are working out much a closer
match to reaching 20,000 on our 35th anniversary than anyone,
myself included, would likely have predicted.

However, especially since I am planning on taking a week off,
right at July 4th, I am best man at my best friend's wedding,
I am trying to get as much as possible done before I leave as
soon as I can after sending out the Newsletter a week before.

I am working on the July 5th Newsletter, and will have it out
in a fairly complete manner half a day after the previous one
goes out, and am hoping that some of our volunteers will have
the wherewithal to update it and send it out July 5th with an
entirely up to date revision, that hopefully will hit 20,000.

If you have any books that are near completion, but would not
be totally through all the various processes, we can put them
in the "PrePrints" section now, where perhaps a few people in
the next few weeks can help with them.


More later,

I'm just trying to make it one day at a time right now. . . .

express my gratitude for the services you provide. Thank you all for your work 
and dedication. Your work is profoundly appreciated. I am a Peace Corps 
Volunteer working deep in rural Namibia. I had always admired Project Gutenberg 
(even donating some time through Distributed Proofreaders) but I have only 
begun to realize how truly important it is since I have been here. When I was 
in America it was nice to have access to books whenever I felt like it, without 
having to go to the trouble of going to a library or bookshop, but here it is 
vital. Bookshops are rare in Namibia (the nearest one to my village is over 250 
kilometres away) and the books they sell are often very very expensive 
(especially considering my limited financial resources.) Also, the books they 
sell are often only in Afrikaans or German, neither of which I understand 
(Peace Corps taught me the tribal language in my village?KhoeKhoe?instead.) 
Libraries are even rarer and often badly under stocked. I am trying to build up 
a school library, but we are dependent on donations and it is much more 
important to get easy to read picture books to help the children with their 
English than to get classics for my own consumption. Project Gutenberg has 
become my library. I didn?t realize the importance of plain vanilla texts until 
I got here and realized how slow and expensive internet is. The zipped plain 
vanilla texts often take less than 5 or 10 minutes to download and provide 
hours of reading enjoyment. Thank you for being an equalizing force in 
literacy, allowing books to reach those who would otherwise have a hard time 
getting them. Your work is thoroughly appreciated. I have shared your site with 
other volunteers who also enjoy it. Thank you so much. I am immensely grateful.

Sincerely,

Amy Elizabeth Pedersen
Here is the announcement of Project Gutenberg first national
public exposure, at the Chicago Mid-Winter ALA Meeting, 1990:


Date:         Sun, 10 Dec 89 11:24:26 CST
From:         "Michael S. Hart" <HART@UIUCVME.BITNET>
Subject:      Machine Readable Texts Breakfast at ALA Midwinter


The Project Gutenberg breakfast has been scheduled for 8:00
to 10:00 A.M. on Saturday, January 6th at the Vie de France
restaurant, located at the foot of the escalator descending
from the East Tower Atrium Plaza; one may see the escalator
directly from the Registration and Concierge's desks, which
have both escalator and elevator service adjoining them.  A
second escalator connects the desk to the lower level where
a neon sign on a door to Catch a Rising Star is just to the
right of the escalator to the Vie de France (the sign above
this escalator reads "Grand Ballroom, Columbus Hall, Retail
Shopping")  Should you require directions, the Concierge is
Sarah and she or one of her staff will gladly assist.  This
desk can be reached at (312) 565-1234:  ask for Concierge's
Desk, please.  Assistance for anyone who requires elevators
is immediately available.  The walk across the Atrium Plaza
is a bit circuitous, but entertaining.  Please feel free to
contact me if you require special dietary consideration.  I
just returned from our preliminary visits to the sites, and
to the ALA office and I am quite impressed and pleased.  We
should all look forward to having a wonderful time.


Michael S. Hart, Director, Project Gutenberg
National Clearinghouse for Machine Readable Texts

P.S.  The food is light, wonderful, inexpensive (not free).

Subject:      Alice in Wonderland is available via FTP

Alice is now on the MRCNEXT@UIUC.CSO.EDU machine and can be downloaded
via FTP at no charge, though the Duncan Reseach copyright is included,
in a copyleft spinoff.  When you log in (you can use this above BITNET
address, or 128.174.73.105, if your location and programming prefer an
address of that nature) you should then be in the /micro directory one
level above the /micro/etext directory where you should find ALICE.TXT
which is the book with a header explaining about the file.

Please let me know how you do in getting this file, so I can write any
more instructions necessary for easy availability.

Thanks,

Michael  (P.S.  I just made a deal for 50G of storage)

Subject:      12/91 Non-network Gutenberg Newsletter
To:           "Michael S. Hart" <HART@UIUCVMD.BITNET>

Special Non-Network Edition of the Project Gutenberg Newsletter

Our #1 goal:  give away one trillion etexts by the end of 2001,
by giving ten thousand etexts to one hundred million people.

#2:  To make these etexts universally usable on virtually every
combination of computers and programs.  (Plain Ascii etext such
as you are reading now is the only way we know of, so far.)

#3:  the founding of a Public Domain Register in 1997, on 100th
anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Copyright Register.  **

December, 1991  (Thanks for your patience as we adapt for mail,
as opposed to our usual format of electronic mail.  We can't do
the same newsletter for both, as most of the e-mail newsletters
deal with electronic transmission of our books.)  The first few
paper newsletters may look a little odd, as we are cutting from
our email newsletter and pasting here, and some items may be in
here twice, etc. * Michael S. Hart, Director, Project Gutenberg

This month's release is Roget's Thesaurus (roget11x.txt or zip)
Last month's release was Aesop's Fables   (aesop11x.txt or zip)
A full listing of the 12 monthly Project Gutenberg releases for
1991 has been appended to the end of this newsletter.  Alice28,
aesop11, and roget11 are now becoming available.  Alice28 is an
upgrade of significance with many spelling, punctuation, even a
few missing line, errors having been corrected.

You may see some very similar etexts for sale on CDROM or disks
for well over $100, the CIA World Factbook for example is being
sold on CDROM for prices ranging from over $50 to over $125 (is
available in our edition as file world11).

Thank you for your interest in our work.  We hope you will feel
you can cooperate and assist.  One of the best ways you can for
the present is to relay the newsletters and disks for others to
use.  That way we won't get as swamped with mail requests as we
already are.  Please give our disks and newsletters to computer
clubs and libraries whenever you can.  We find more and more of
the libraries are willing to add our electronic book collection
to their paper book collection.  If they are very worried about
viruses and things like that, remind them that our files aren't
programs, but only English words, and thus cannot contain virus
programs of any nature.

Most of our work is done via network communications or via hand
to hand swapping of disks.  Long distance paper or disk mailing
has not been our strong suit in the past, but we make an effort
to get electronic books into the hands of all who desire them.

A great advantage of the computer networks is that we only post
a book once and a million people can make their own copies very
easily and quickly.  What we ask of you is to do the same sorts
of things as a human networking systems so we can get our books
out there to everyone without having to send individual copies.
Therefore we ask you to help others make copies of newsletters,
books, Shareware text reading programs, etc.  Even if every one
of the letters we get contained a large donation, we would lose
time and effort from the process of making the books because we
would be spending that time and effort in mailing.  We have not
wanted to become a large impersonal operation, so far all these
letters and requests have been answered and handled by myself--
with assistance from friends all around the world.  I hope this
will continue, and you will never have to get a letter typed by
a secretary.  If you can get our newsletter and books into more
hands, then you will help us in this manner.  Please encourage,
assist, and otherwise promote your local computer BBS, network,
or whatever to help keep us from getting swamped.  We don't get
our satisfaction from distributing the books directly, we would
never be able to do it directly without becoming a corporation,
and a large one at that.  We hope you will be the ones to see a
light in the eyes of the people you give your favorite book to.

We have not refused files to anyone who asked but we must try a
bit to get stamps, disks and handling paid for.  So far we have
done quite well in this area with no one donating less than $10
for us sending them a disk.  No one has ever sent us a cent for
the books they get over the networks, but our network connected
work is paid for by outside sources, so we break even there.  A
computer distribution network is very easy to run.

However, one of our biggest problems is the time and expense of
dealing with paper mail.  If you could send stamps and labels a
great deal of this time and expense could be eliminated.  It is
cheaper for your to send stamps and labels than the SASLE's.  L
is for legal/business sized envelopes, as it is hard to put the
whole newsletters into smaller envelopes.  You might spend more
in mailing us disks and envelopes than it would cost otherwise,
as we buy disks in mass quantities and we wouldn't want to have
to have you pay for mailing things in both directions.

One of the greatest problems we have is that people send us $10
or more for etexts without telling us what kind of disk to send
them.  Please be as specific as you can as follows:

This is a special letter I am writing to those with whom we are
communicating via regular mail rather than via electronic mail,
or email (e-mail), as we call it.

In our newsletter, which is normally distributed to some 10,000
people on the various computer networks and services (Internet,
Bitnet, CompuServe, etc.) we usually refer to instructions to a
network listserver and fileserver for getting mail and books or
sending them in to us.  The same things are available through a
letter or by mailing a disk.  Please remember to specify what a
disk is formatted for. . .whether you are sending it to us as a
book for our collection or whether you are requesting one.  Our
volunteers can read or make disks in nearly any format, but you
have to tell us what kind.  Example:  the most common disks are
IBM 360K.  That alone is enough to tell us what we need, but if
you would like to add 5 1/4" or 9 sector or any other pieces of
information about your disks to insure compatibility, please do
so.  Our most common formats are:
IBM 360K, 1.2M, 720K, 1.44M.
    DSDD,  HD   DSDD   HD    DSDD=Double Sided Double Density
    5.25" 5.25" 3.5"  3.5"    HD = High Density
    Frequently the 1.44M 3.5 inch disks say 2M,
    that is unformatted size, you get to use 1.44 Megabytes.

Mac 800K and high density (not usually called by size, but they
    hold twice as much as the 800K)

On request we will try to make disks for Apples, Ataris, Amigas
and even the new 2.88M sized 3.5" disks.  If this is too much a
burden to think about, you can describe your computer to us and
we will be able to make a good guess as to what kind of disk is
right for that computer.  Please also call your dealer to get a
better idea of what kind of disk you need.

If you can find a local computer club, network or BBS (Bulletin
Board Service) they can assist you in getting the books into an
etext or disk format suitable for your own private use.  One of
the great advantages of our network distribution is that when a
text is copied from a network to your computer, it is automatic
that it appears in the proper disk format for your computer.  A
modem copying from another computer does the same thing.
We are somewhat reluctant to cash the checks people send in, if
we don't know what kind of disks to send them.  Remember you do
not buy our books, they are free.  The donations are to Project
Gutenberg/Illinois Benedictine College (You may abbreviate IBC)
and since they will be going to the college funds, they will be
tax deductible.  If you can get the books via network or modem,
please do so, as we are not prepared for mass mailings of disks
or the purchase of stamps.  Nevertheless, we want everyone from
everywhere to be able to get our books so please don't hesitate
to send us a self-addressed stamped disk mailer and a donation,
you will get your disks and will be encouraged to share them in
any manner you can.  Some people put them in public libraries.

Please send to:
Project Gutenberg
405  West Elm St.
Urbana, IL  61801

You are most thoroughly invited to proofread our books while in
the process of using them.  Your suggestions will be checked on
during the creation of our next edition of that book.  Etext is
very easy to edit, and you may be happy to hear that we will be
soon releasing the 28th edition of Alice in Wonderland due to a
continuing interest in helping us creating the best editions.

THIS NOTE IS ABOUT NETWORK ACCESS;
AFTER YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A NETWORK

(This note sent intentionally at non-peak period)

ACCESS *ON* NETWORKS AFTER ACCESS *TO* THE NETWORKS

This is the November 15, 1992 edition of Newsletter2
It is actually being posted on November 25 at 6:00AM
(There was no October 15, 1992 edition, honoring the
newly founded "Lurkers Week" when time was set aside
to encourage those who usually speak to set aside an
annual week for the usually silent to speak; and due
to research on this edition.  To those who like much
of what I have written, my apologies. . .I have done
a lot of toning down, editing and inserted suggested
comments from my advisory board.  Therefore, this is
not written in the usual manner and may appear some-
what less cohesive and longer than usual.

However, the content is well worth your considerated
effort to read, even if form is less than usual.)
====================================================

Trends are beginning to limit access on the networks.

I would like to see these trends reversed.

When the systems are optimized for the experts, what
happens to the optimization for the novices?

Which will yield more results, optimization for past
masters of the systems, or optimization for the 99%,
who are not going to master driving on the internet,
any more than the average driver masters driving the
cars on race tracks?

Help yourselves optimize the systems for yourself.
We should encourage readers to use the delete key,
rather than discourage persons from posting notes.

Limiting size and number of postings because some of
the people don't want to have to delete them is like
limiting what books go into a library because people
have said they don't want to have to walk past books
they don't want to read to get to ones they do read.
  [Yes, there are applicable limits:  see below]

[For those who want to limit notes to Sound-Bytes...
the above was what you would get.  What you get from
me is NOT Sound-Bytes.  However, I will assist those
who don't want to see my messages so they can delete
them as follows:

msh 9 R Access ON Networks is the subject line of this message:
indicating the following:  Who From, Number of Pages, Subject.
Only 5 characters identifies this note as FROM ME, 9 PAGES and
it is a REPLY about Access ON Networks [not Access TO Networks])

WARNING:  this message is NOT stated in the typical short
"Sound-Byte" manner unofficially approved of by several of the
lists I am posting it on.  For those who don't like messages
longer than Sound-Bytes, press the delete key now.

[The official limits on the size of email are set by various
mailer programs, and are usually 100,000 to 250,000 characters.
However, certain social pressures are trying to limit messages
to around 1,000 to 2,500 characters (social limits here are 99
time more powerful than the technological limits).  They also
want to limit the number of messages a person may send by
various pressures described below.  The methods are contradictory
. . .some people have stated they don't want to spend the time to
read messages longer than a Sound-Byte, but have also stated that
they don't want to receive very many messages in total.

Given the fact that network traffic is tripling every year,
these people are applying social pressures to limit technological
capabilities, trying to limit access to network conversations.
If they are going to succeed in this effort, they will have to
be three times as powerful in their efforts in 1993 as they were
in 1992. . .hopefully these efforts will become more obvious due
this required intensification, and thus will be dropped.

These pressures are couched in buzzword terms, such as
"bandwidth" to make people think they are trying to save
the resources of the networks, but the truth of the matter
is that they are trying to reduce network traffic to their
own "personal bandwidth levels" where they are comfortable
with the number of messages, the length of messages, and
the subjects of those messages.  When someone posts notes
they don't agree with, they respond with comments about
everything BUT the substantive content of the messages.
They talk about the length, the style, the semantics and
ad hominem comments about the author but not the content.
If their memories were longer, they would remind us that
using the networks is like "drinking from a firehose," an
analogy that get just about as much mileage as wanting a
library to only contain the books you want to read.  No one
has the nerve to suggest that even the most specialized of
Public Libraries or Special Libraries should contain ONLY
books of interest to them as individuals, or that books one
person requests are not valid when the subject is libraries
and their usage.

The fact is that these discussions should also be tripling
in their traffic, along with the rest of the Networld.
These people would rather distract you with discussions
on the "meaning" of "lurker," "wallflower" or "kibitzer"
than discuss the substantive real issue to discourage or
encourage others to join the discussion.

They would also prefer to ridicule the exchange of notes
on topics they would prefer not to see discussed via the
methods of saying "If you can discuss topics I don't see
as what I want, then I will post notes in response I can
be sure will be ones everyone else will not want to see,
with the obvious result that ALL our notes will become a
source of irritation and will either not be read or will
not get posted at all."  Immature, but often effective.

THIS IS A MESSAGE ABOUT MESSAGES

Now, I am not saying that all messages are suitable for all
discussions, but a message concerning how the discussions
are carried on is always valid, and messages inviting those
who usually don't contribute to have a say are also valid.
Granted that there are groups devoted to specific subjects,
and there should be, but the issues of group access and of
fields related to the main field are valid for discussion.


ACCESS *TO* THE NETWORKS VERSUS ACCESS *ON* THE NETWORKS

It is sad enough that most of the people never post notes,
but it is unconscionable to discourage them from posting.
Messages encouraging and complimenting people for keeping
quiet are nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to be
one of the people who sit at the main podium with a gavel.
Since no one can actually interrupt anyone else on network
discussions, there is no way one person can "have the floor."
Any individual who doesn't want to hear. . .can simply wipe
out others remarks in one second by using the delete key,
they have an infinitely powerful gavel. . .FOR THEMSELVES;
they just don't get to bang it in everyone else's ears and
that bothers them.  They would rather keep OTHERS from being
heard by OTHERS. . .RATHER THAN MERELY LEAVE THEMSELVES OUT.

However, to try to delete the remarks for every other person
who might be listening reeks of censorship in a place where
speech could/should be many times freer than "on the floor."

When suggestions appear that they simply delete messages they
don't want to read, the response has been that it takes too
long to open each message to make such a decision.  If this
message were broken down into smaller segments, as some would
have it, that process would take even longer.

CONTENTS

The following is approximately 7 pages and addresses:

1.  Elimination of access to Plain Vanilla ASCII files.

2.  Pressure to speak in narrowly specified manners:

    A.  Pressure not to speak at all.

    B.  Pressure to speak in Sound-Bytes.

    C.  Pressure to speak in "journal articles"

    E.  Pressure not to address certain issues.

    F.  Pressure not to address a wide audience.


This note is being posted to a handful of lists, each of which
have had at least a 3 to 1 ratio of people who have sent notes
asking me to post there, as opposed to those who expressed the
opposing point of view.  When that ratio drops to 50/50 I have
decided to throw the idea of posting to the moderators of that
list, rather than to continue posting directly.  This invites,
if you will, the opposition to a "tyranny of the majority" but
at least might have a chance to eliminate an invisible attempt
to create a tyranny of a very small minority.

This article has been rewritten many times, something I do not
usually do even once. . .and some of my advisors have said the
original was better than some of the edited versions.  However
the original was too negative for me and I wanted to provide a
more positive side of the coin to look at, so I have tried the
process of projecting more of the positive side, rather than a
more anti-negative approach. . .think about it. . .saying that
"people should have an ENABLING POWER offered to them," is not
equivalent to saying "people should NOT have a DISABLING POWER
applied to them."  One extends a positive hand to everyone and
the other extends a negative hand to the negative influences--
I would prefer to be positive than anti-negative.

Reversing these trends is not something one person should even
try to do alone.  So. . .if you leave me alone, I will go away
and not try this again for a long time.

*I am not trying to take on the powers-that-be in a cause one*
*person could not possibly hope to win, but I would regret it*
*if I did not make the opportunity to speak at this time when*
*the trends might be reversed so early in network life.*

The only purpose here is to make these trends evident,
the rest of you networkers will have to deal with them,
but will hopefully have a better chance to see them now.
Network trends are in motion that are withdrawing novice access
to greater distances than before.  They are:

1.  Increased distance between experts and novices.
    Makes it harder for information to trickle down.
    Create your own guru system, and when you find
    out things from wizards and manuals, share them.

2.  Storage of materials in compressed formats.
    Makes is harder for novices to get information.
    Teach each other how to uncompress files.
    Encourage at least SOME posting of important
    files in uncompressed formats.  Remind them
    NOT ALL COMPUTERS SUPPORT ALL COMPRESSIONS.

3.  Encoding of materials in markup formats.
    Makes it harder for people to read information.
    Insist on clear dissemination of information,
    in addition to the marked-up formats.  Remind them
    NOT ALL COMPUTERS SUPPORT ALL MARKUP FORMATS.


4.  Pressure not to write to email discussion groups.
    Makes it harder for people to share their thoughts.
    Remind them:  THEY WERE NOVICES ONCE, TOO.

5.  A lack of advice on what to do when things go wrong.
    (Start right now to solve this one. . .when you find
    new information about the systems, share it with the
    people you know.  Often people think they don't know
    enough to teach others but often the best teacher is
    the person who just learned it.  When no one knows a
    thing we all have to work together to find and share
    the information.)  BE YOUR OWN GURUS WHEN YOU CAN!!!


DEFINITIONS, CAUSES, and SOLUTIONS (send me yours)

1.  Increased distance between experts and novices.

The longer any system remains in place, the more potential for
distance to grow between those who have been in the system the
longest and the shortest.  (True of all systems, social, too.)

Everyone enters the system as a novice, and then moves along a
growth path.  When the system is new, everyone is a novice and
there is little or no chance for disparities.  This is also in
effect when there are massive system changes, and suddenly all
are equal in terms of learning the newly changed elements.  No
one knows anything at the beginning, so they all share, rather
than trying to prove they know something others don't.

New systems, by definition, are composed of equal members, the
exception, of course, being those who designed the system.  As
time goes on, and more new people enter the system, a veteran,
expert or another class will appear, as distinct from a novice
class (is continually replaced by new system members).  Novice
members need more sharing of information than veterans but are
less likely to. . .get your novices together to make what your
efforts turn up get more mileage.  Share Information!

Without much in the way of intention of effort, a growing gulf
appears between the newest and oldest members of the systems.

Systems grow: "by extending the number of important operations
which we can perform without thinking about them."   Whitehead

The wizards who perform actions without thinking about them at
all are not going to be the best teachers. . .those who know a
thing just well enough to remember how they learned it are, or
those who truly practice the arts and sciences of teaching.

[I think he also said something like "the only purpose schools
have is to unite the experiences and knowledge of the old with
the energy of the new."]

When the veterans of the system optimize the system for expert
skills they also make it optimized less and less for those who
do not have those expert skills, without thinking about it.

Of course, not all advancements require expert skills; example
efforts of those who provide Archie, Gopher and other powerful
but simple tools should be greatly appreciated.

An example of experts requiring more than novice skills is:

2.  Storage of materials in compressed formats.  [Example, now
it now takes more skill to find and read Alice in Wonderland--
than it did a year ago, or two years ago, or three years ago--
not a great trend in network access.]

A couple days ago I had a librarian come visit here to see the
demonstrations we do of various network and workstations tools
available.  One of the demonstrations we do is to search for a
copy of Alice in Wonderland, one of the most widely ranging of
the electronic books on the networks.  "archie -s alice" was a
normal choice for the first search, and we were stunned to see
dozens of compressed copies of Alice out there, but not one of
the uncompressed versions had apparently survived some massive
deletion during the past few months.  We emailed our guru, and
reported this.  It turns out that Archie normally does not get
results past 95 matches.  While this was being discovered, the
searches we were doing finally found the one, single, solitary
copy of Alice29.txt. . .and we found it was on a system we had
already gotten results from in our first search.  We were sure
we had found a major bug, since the file was there, but was no
hit on the first search, which reported several zipped copies,
on that very same site.

After much of a to do, it was determined that Archie does this
search in a non-linear manner, and doesn't find all the copies
in one system at a time, and when it reaches the 95 matches it
just stops in its tracks, thus leaving us with the impressions
of a complete search of whatever sites were listed. . .kind of
like a short person looking on library shelves and reporting--
quite accurately--that they had not found the book they should
have hoped to find, but that they found several others by that
author on the shelf.

Even with our new found power to modify Archie searches, these
searches only ever turned up one text copy of Alice, even with
multiple (sometimes five) compressed copies on one machine.  A
set of probably unrelated events had resulted in the deletions
of all the text files of Alice except one, within the reach of
the Archie searches.

The point is that compressed files are so mandatory these days
that novices are not likely to find an uncompressed version of
one of the most widely distributed etexts on the networks, and
if they don't know how to uncompress it. . . .

It is kind of a Catch-22. . .the expert knows enough to find a
version of Alice29.txt, and they also know how to uncompress a
compressed version, should they tire of looking. . .the novice
doesn't know either way.

A few months ago this demonstration would locate text files on
many systems, because zip, tar and .Z files were not so much a
totally overwhelming majority of files everywhere.  For people
who were not yet familiar with compressed files, trying a read
on these files gave them nothing but gobbledygook. . .but text
files were easily available, so it was no big deal.

Now the text file is all but extinct, while there are more and
more files available to the more educated, and fewer and fewer
to the novices, with so many more megabytes at cheaper prices,
why are the text files vanishing?

This is even [or should I say especially?] true of files of an
interest to the novice such as Zen and the Art of the Internet
and the NUSIRG guide, which are two of the most popular guides
to the networks.  However, neither of them was etext available
in a text file format until independent parties did the effort
to convert them from "marked up" files to "Plain Vanilla ASCII
Text" files during the past few months.  [Perhaps we should do
one historical note here. . .only a few years ago there was no
such thing as a .zip file. . .and they have already just about
driven the .txt files into extinction, and novice access along
with it.  [3.  Encoding of materials in markup formats.]


4.  Pressure not to write to email discussion groups.

Another limitation facing the novices is lack of encouragement
to talk to those who are already veterans on the networks.

I feel they should be encouraged, not discouraged, as follows:

There are two ways in which one can show one's expertise:

one is to share that expertise with those who don't have it in
a manner to encourage them to move up from their present level
. . .the other is just the opposite, keeping them from rising.

Sometimes this is not as intentional as it might sound.

As the distance from the novice level rises, it is a difficult
thing to keep in touch with the novice, even if you try to.  I
used to teach classes on computer-phobia, getting new users in
the stream of things, and I found that after more than a dozen
times I simply could not talk to them in the language required
as I had reached Whitehead's level, doing things automatically
so much that it was difficult to go out of automatic mode in a
decreasingly successful effort to communicate with novices.  I
finally gave up teaching this course several years ago.

Therefore, I cast no aspersions at people who are in a similar
position. . .but, I encourage them to try, and understand that
this effort cannot continue forever, unless one happens to be
truly gifted in the proper manner.

At the same time, there ARE things we can do consciously to be
more inviting of novices to join the networks. . .after all it
is only one percent of the people who are already on the nets,
and thus, from the current perspective, nearly everyone on the
planet is yet to enter even the novice areas of networking.

One of the things we can and should do, is make communications
easier for the novices, to post materials in easily read files
in easy to get at places.  It is totally astonishing how great
a number of supposedly important postings are made so that the
majority of the people are never going to read them. . .and it
seems too prevalent not to consider the possibility that it is
intentional by design. . .so that one may do a study or a poll
and get responses only from the audience that one wished to be
getting answer from.  In such a manner one could elect a Dewey
when the majority preferred a Truman.

[In the 1948 US Presidential election, all the polls showed an
overwhelming majority for Dewey, even to the point at which an
enterprising major newspaper printed "DEWEY WINS!" as a banner
headline before the election returns were totally counted.  As
it was the rural regions that carried the vote for Truman, the
early returns showed the overwhelming expected majority and it
was only when all the votes were counted that Truman won.  The
polls were the first effort at telephone interviewing, and the
pollsters neglected those who didn't have telephones, thus the
Truman supporters never were reported in the polls, but were a
victorious majority at the other (real) polls.]

This is being done by posting RFC's [Requests for Comments] in
formats that limit the respondents to those who can read SGML,
NROFF, TROFF, PostScript, TEX, LATEX, in TAR, Z or ZIP format.

Only a small minority of the network users are easily familiar
with these formats in a sufficient manner to be comfortable in
FTPing such files, decoding them onto screen or paper and then
generating a sufficient response.

This effectively silences the average person from responding--
or even reading the questionnaire.

Some people would like us to think that a majority is using an
mark-up from the list above, but the truth is that not even an
example can be found of one of those markups being used in the
email traffic we see. . . .  Why not?  Because they know email
readers will not be able to easily read such messages.  If .ps
(PostScript) files were truly a standard, then we would see an
entire fleet of messages sent in PostScript, same for the rest
of them.  90% of the readers are not proper recipients for any
marked-up kinds of files, hence they are not sent.

With only one percent of the people on the networks now, and a
very small minority (myself included, of course) speaking out,
the potential exists for this very, very, very small minority,
one percent of one percent, to establish trends which novices,
even experts, of the future will regard as written in stone.

I take this opportunity, which opportunity I hope will present
itself to all networkers of the future, to encourage the other
99% of the 1% and the other other 99% of the entire population
to be heard, and to be heard in the manner they desire.

There sometimes is a concerted effort to limit a participation
on various listservers, either to the short "Sound-Byte" notes
or to the longest variety of notes of the paper "Peer-Reviewed
Journal" variety.

. . .in either case the authors are limited to writing manners
or styles not terribly effective to a majority of the people.

"Sound Bytes" are cute, but don't really say enough to have an
effect. . ."journal articles" are so formal that only smallest
numbers of readers actually read. . .neither are effective for
changing things.  Only when the message migrates to some media
that allow in-between efforts at communication, does effective
and influential communication occur.

What we need is the freedom to write short, medium or long; so
encouragement for in-between lengths and formalities should be
included rather than excluded.  More alternatives, not less.

Now that the first of the electronic journals is being printed
by a major scholarly publisher, the schism between the "Sound-
Byte" notes and the "Peer-Reviewed Journal Article" notes is a
potential major factor in the future of list oriented email.

If we only allow "Sound-Bytes" or "Journal Articles" we are to
lose the entire range in between, and personally, I don't feel
either "Sound-Bytes" or "Journal Articles" are the major types
of notes that can have maximal effectiveness. . .and who wants
to read, or write, ineffective notes, or to be limited to long
and short, but see nothing of a more moderate length?


5.  A lack of advice on what to do when things go wrong.

Wizards and gurus often have many accounts on many computers--
which yield a wider variety of alternatives.  When efforts are
failing on one system, it is easy for them to switch over from
that system to other systems, something they do regularly, but
something those with less expertise, who have greater need for
alternatives, are never told.

Everyday usage of programs such as ZIP, FTP, TELNET, etc. have
various methods and rates of success on different computers, a
fact the experts know all too well, but which the novices have
no idea about.  So many times when FTP or TELNET fails to make
a successful connection, the expert merely switches to another
computer account and tries it from there, as each FTP, TELNET,
or other program operates slightly differently in hardware and
software combinations which are slightly different.  Ofttimes,
and more often then you might think, this effort is successful
in performing tasks easily on one computer that might not work
at all on another computer.  Last night was a perfect example:
I got so much email that my mainframe disk was overloaded, and
I had to copy a bunch of it here to make room sooner than I am
usually prepared for. . .however, the transfers kept crashing.
The solution was to send my mail to another mainframe and then
to transfer them from there.  Someone who is not fluent with a
variety of processes and accounts is not going to have this as
a viable alternative, and they are going to panic when message
after message appears telling them there was an error when the
logoff sequence they usually use fail due to disk overload.

The same is true for allowing access to various modem numbers,
connections methods, etc., which the experts know to use, when
things have failed on one connection, and alternatives are the
order of the day.  All of you are probably already, or soon to
be, aware that your computers and connections are not totally,
completely reliable. . .often closer to 90% than to 100% . . .
however, alternative methods are not well publicized.

Please find and help others to find alternative methods.


SUMMARY

The networks are truly still in their infancy, but people feel
they are already cast in stone.  This is an effort in avoiding
casting so many items in stone that the future of the networks
could be socially limited by the actions we are taking today--
even. . .or especially when the networks are more capable of a
support system for the average person. . .but when support may
be reserved for those with higher levels of expertise.

Will "Network Drivers' Licenses" be used to keep new users off
the nets, or could they be used to insure they have methods of
instruction provided to them?  [Will the instruction be enough
to ENABLE them to really use the networks?  Or might it be the
tool some people want to keep them out of their hair?]

The actions we take to today should be those of "ENABLING" the
new members of the network community, not those of "DISABLING"
them from various alternatives that might have been present in
the past, present or future.

Why is it harder to find a text file of Alice in Wonderland in
the present day networks, with the aid of Archie, than a while
back, without Archie?

The networks are capable of storing more, transferring it more
quickly, and making things easier all around. . .then why does
it seem more difficult?


      If You Don't Defend the Networks, Who Will?

Dear Sir,
         in your December newsletter you included a request
for someone to rewrite and "tidy up" the newsletter format.
Accordingly, I respectfully submit the following draft for
your consideration. It is somewhat shorter than the original
text, but this is due (I hope) to the repetition of
information in the original, rather than any omissions.

DRAFT NEWSLETTER (BASED ON NEWSLETTER DEC. 1993)
-------------------------------------------------
*Table of Contents*

1. About this Newsletter
2. Items new to this newsletter
3. What is Project Gutenburg?
4. Availability of Gutenburg Etexts
5. Index of the first 100 Gutenburg Etexts
6. Contact addresses for Project Gutenburg

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. About this Newsletter

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December, 1993
It is a statement of the Project's current status. It is
also your guide to the availability of Gutenburg texts, and
the means of accessing these texts.

For those who have not heard of the Gutenburg Project, we
recommend that you read this document in its entirety. For
those who just want to know what's available, have a look
at sections four and five. If you're already familiar with
the newsletter, just browse through the next section.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Items new to this newsletter
{Hot Items to be placed here, then shifted to an
 appropriate section before the next publication}

Project Gutenberg congratulates Internet Wiretap and the Oxford
Text Archives on increased creation and distribution of Etexts,
and would also like to congratulate the Online Book Initiative.
A special congratulations to our first corporate sponsor of the
copyrighted Complete Works of Shakespeare:  World Library.  You
can get over a thousand Etexts from the World Library on CDROM.
Please email them at julianc@netcom.com or call 1-800-443-0238,
or 1-714-748-7197 or fax 1-714-748-7198.

Thank you NeXT, for loaning us that machine!!!  Thanks also to
Apple, Calera, CTA (TextPert), IBM, Caere and World Library.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Project Gutenburg?

Project Gutenburg is a non-profit organisation, established
in 1971, dedicated to the production and distribution of
electronic texts (Etexts). Project Gutenburg Etexts are
prepared by hundreds of volunteers and donations.
Our goal is to give away One Trillion Etexts by
December 31, 2001.

[We estimate that every title will reach 100 million people
by the end of 2001, so this goal would require publishing
10,000 titles.]

In an effort to make Project Gutenburg Etexts universal we
have ended each line with a "carriage return" AND a "line
feed" so a user on any computer can read them. Macs require
a cf, UNIX machines require a lf, DOS machines require both.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Availability of Gutenburg Etexts

This is _NOT_ a complete listing, but a general guide as to
where Gutenburg publications may be found.

4.0  General info
4.1  Index sites
4.2  Anon. FTP sites
4.3  BBS sites
4.4  E-mail services

- 4.0 General info -

About getting Project Gutenberg Etexts before the end of
months: the official release date of each of our books is
the last day of the month.  If you get any books before that
date please check on the first days of the next month to
insure you have the permanent copy rather than a preliminary
copy.  Many errors are corrected a few days before the
official release date.

- 4.1 Indexes -

Project Gutenberg is testing a new indexing program.
You can get this index, which is updated daily, by:

anonymous FTP to mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12)

Some of our etexts are available via the Cleveland Freenet.
You can call via modem at 1-216-368-3888.

- 4.4 E-mail Services -

****
FTPMail service which allows FTP requesta via EMail.  The address is:

                ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

If you want to get a file in this way try sending your equivalent of the
following message to the above address. You don't need a subject. If you are
lucky you will receive your etext by email. I use Compuserve which has a 50K
maximum file size which is why I have to request my files broken
up into 50K chunks.

        connect 128.174.201.12  (this is the address of the ftp server)
        chdir etext/etext93   (this changes to the right directory)
        chunksize 50000       (this gives the maximum size file I can receive)
        ascii             (use "binary" if you want to get a compressed file)
        get wman10.txt    (this is the file name and file type of the etext.
        quit              (this is self-explanatory)

****
The Almanac Information Server, located at the Extension Service
at Oregon State University, allows text retrieval both through ftp and
email.

To retrieve a file via e-mail, first send the following line by
itself to almanac@oes.orst.edu

     send gutenberg catalog

This will instruct you how to send further requests, and will list
the available files.  For example, to retrieve _Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland_, send to almanac@oes.orst.edu

     send gutenberg alice

-----------------------------------------------------------
5. Index of the first 100 Gutenburg Etexts

This is an index of the first 100 Project Gutenberg Etexts [gutindex.100]
It is no longer part of the Newsletters but will be independently sent.
The January, 1994 Newsletter will start again with the 1994 indices.

For now the 1994 Etexts are being stored in etext/etext93 so you can get
them more easily for Holiday Season gift giving.  In 1994 they will move
to etext/etext94.  For those who wish to volunteer early, we should like
to try to get the 200th Etext out by Thanksgiving, 1994, as we have seen
that a huge portion of you are rarely on the nets during the Holidays.

[A "C" following the number indicates a copyrighted Etext.  When we get
the permission to post a copyrighted Etext in our CDROMs, or on another
fee-based access medium, the "C" will be changed to a lower cased "c"].

You may note that by the standards by which we started Project Gutenberg
in 1971 that the following list contains closer to 300 Etext titles, for
we originally indexed each book of the Bible, and each Shakespeare play,
major poem, and the Sonnets, as a single file, most of which were larger
than our entire output for the 1970's.  By those standards the Bible and
Shakespeare alone represent nearly 150 titles [two Bible editions] and a
new Shakespeare is in the works.

NOTES FROM THE DIRECTOR

We have recruited a Project Gutenberg Coordinator to assist the volunteers.
Mark P. Line (gutcoord@jg.cso.uiuc.edu) is an experienced coordinator, and
will be happy to assist those who have volunteered: especially volunteers
who have not found the right Etexts to work on, or those who need help for
the completion of Etexts too large for one person to handle.

Again, my most sincere apologies to those volunteers who felt they weren't
getting the instructions or cooperation required for them to fulfill their
hopes and Project Gutenberg Volunteers; Mark's presence is the result of
a rather intensive search, and we hope you will be very glad to have him.&nbsp;

As always, I am terrified of the prospect of doubling our output to 16 Etexts
per month for next year, we really need your help!!!

HOT OFF THE PRESSES--NEW INFORMATION

*August 26th, 1994 marked the 74th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the
*U.S. Constitution, on which date we announce the release of these etexts

You can find the U.S. Constitution and amendments as Project Gutenberg Etexts
#2 and #3, dated 1972 and 1973 in /pub/etext/etext90 as per directions
below.

A "C" following the Etext number indicated a COPYRIGHTED Electronic
Text.

Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of
the last day of the the month of this announcement. The official release
date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight, Central Time, of the
last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for
suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you
have an up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in
the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has a bug in it that
scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a look at the file size will
have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more
or less.

THE GUTENBERG PROJECT

The Gutenberg Project, founded in 1971 by Michael Hart, who still directs
the project, is aimed towards making public-domain documents freely available
in electronic form. What this means to you is that there are now many novels,
short-stories, reference books, and information texts available over the
internet, from your local network, or on disk. (Methods of obtaining the
texts are explained in detail in section 4.) At present, over one hundred
full texts are available, ranging from Moby Dick, through the Declaration
of Independance and the Bible, to the CIA World Fact Book.

These texts were produced through the work of hundreds of volunteers, and
aided by many donations. (Yes, you can take that as a hint.)

The texts are all entered in "Plain Vanilla ASCII." This means that they
use only those characters which work on all systems, and can be easily read
by both humans and machines.

In an effort to make Project Gutenberg Etexts universal, we have ended each
line with a "carriage return" AND a "line feed". (Macs require a cr, UNIX
needs an lf, DOS machines require both.

Macs users CAN remove these characters [which Macs use for mark at end of
paragraph] with UUlite, while UNIX users can used the flip or toix command.
[Mac users should be forewarned that the remargination of Etexts can have
some very odd results, back-up your file before you try it.]

ELECTRONIC TEXT AVAILABILITY

4.1 Obtaining texts via ftp at MRCNEXT
4.2 Alternate ftp sites with Gutenberg and/or other Etexts.
4.3 Retrieving texts by E-MAIL using ALMANAC
4.4 Requesting Etexts on Disk or CD
4.5 From Bulletin Board Services

4.1 Obtaining texts via ftp at MRCNEXT

The primary site (ie. this is where all texts make their first appearance)
for retrieving etexts is from the MRCNEXT system. From your home system,
do the following (NB: if you are using a Macintosh or equivalent window-based
system, we recommend that you actually _type_ these commands, since the
file-server is UNIX based, and therefore case-sensitive):
ftp mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu OR
ftp 128.174.201.12
login anonymous
password [PUT HERE your e-mail address]
cd etext
cd etext91, etext92, etext93 or etext94
ls
[this will produce a list of filenames
available]
get filename
[where 'filename' stands for the text
you have selected]
quit

4.2 ALTERNATE FTP SITES

etext.archive.umich.edu 
cd pub/Gutenberg/etext91, 92, 93, 94

nctuccca.edu.tw [192.83.166.10, 140.111.1.10]
cd /documents/electronic-texts/Gutenberg

nptn.org
cd /pub/e.texts/gutenberg/etext91, 92, 93, 94

quake.think.com
cd /pub/etext91, 92, 93, 94

oak.oakland.edu 
wuarchive.wustl.edu 
ftp.cnam.fr

4.3 VIA MAIL

To retrieve a file via E-mail, first send the following message to the server
at ALMANAC@OES.ORST.EDU:

send gutenberg catalog

This will give you a list of available files, along with instructions on
how to retrieve them.

You might also wish to try the FTPmail service, which allows FTP requests
via Email. The address is:

ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

Send a message (no subject) with the following body:

connect 128.174.201.12 
(the address of the ftp server) 
chdir etext/etext93 
(or etext/etext94 etc.) 
chunksize 50000 
(breaks the incoming file into 50k chunks) 
get wman10.txt 
(the file name you wish to receive) 
quit 
(quit)

4.4 DISKS

We are in the process of setting up new people to mail out disks.

For now:

Requests for disks should go to: John Mechalas (pgdisks@jg.cso.uiuc.edu)
or via U.S. Mail to:

Project Gutenberg 
P.O. Box 2782 
Champaign, IL 61825

All Public Domain Etexts up to and including those released December 1993

Books Index update from #240 to #251.

Project Gutenberg has been bringing you Free Electronic Texts since 1971
when there were only about 100 people on the Internet, we hope for more.

Project Gutenberg has reached number 250 in its goal to bring you 10,000
Etexts through the Electronic Public Library Association on the Internet
and off. Many of the books we were planning on bringing you were voided from
the Public Domain by the 1975 US Copyright Act, and we were told we would
have to wait an additional 19 years for them at that time.

For instance, both Winnie-the-Pooh and Hemingway came out in the middle-
1920s, and should have entered the Public Domain no longer than 56 years
later under their orginal copyrights. However, before that could happen in
the early 1980s, things were changed after the fact to make copyright on
these works last for an additional 19 years, for a 75 year total.

House Bill 989 and Senate Bill 483 are once again seeking to extend this
effort to keep materials out of the Public Domain, this time for another
20 years in addition to the first 28 year extension, the second 19 year,
and now another 20 years, for a total of 67 years of extensions on those
original 28 year copyright terms.

Enough said, it should be obvious that if laws such as this continued to
be passed every 20 years or so, that nothing will ever enter into Public
Domain status again and the work of people such as the Internet Wiretap,
the Online Book Initiative, and Project Gutenberg will soon be over, and
no literature or information newer than 1919 will ever be free to send a
whole world of people over the Internet.

Now that we finally have the capacity to create and distribute all these
materials for Unlimited Distribution, it is obvious there are efforts to
keep anyone from doing it. As I have said so many times before, "We are all
going to have the ability to store the Library of Congress on drives that
will be available during our lifetimes. . .but I am not sure that a society
based on Limited Distribution will let us do it."

You may notice that the newest item on this list may help you to voice a
personal opinion about this to Congress, and I urge you to do so whether
your vote is pro or con.

I have just completed 24 years on the Internet, and 48 years on Earth; I
would ask any of you who would be willing to give me a birthday present,
on having completed 2/3 of my expected lifetime, to make some effort for
the continuation of works such as Project Gutenberg in our future. This will
do more to improve the human condition than anything else I can do.

Please try to find a site close to you for accessing Project Gutenberg Etexts.
mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu is getting clogged!!

Here is a partial listing of some of the ftp sites and BBS's carrying the
Project Gutenberg Etexts. As always, the final authority is mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu,
but we would thank you to try at lease a couple of these before trying us
because this site is getting grossly overloaded sometimes, and even I can
not get in all the time to put in the new Etexts.

New Listings:

http://www.technet.sg/singapore-server.html

http://www.np.ac.sg:9080

nptn.org cd /pub/e.text/gutenberg 192.190.49.8

The College Board BBS in Sunset, SC (803) 878-7340?

This list is far from complete, and undoubtedly inaccurate!! Any corrections,
additions or deletions would be appreciated very much, and included in later
listings. Locations of the servers would be nice, so people could increase
efficiency a little bit for the Internet as whole. I have entered some--
but don't know them all.

Included first are US ftp sites, then world ftp sites. Next are BBSs for
the US and the world.

If anyone would care to volunteer to maintain this list just let me know.

PG NEWSLETTER JUNE 1996


Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

This is not the actual newsletter sent out to subscribers, but it is the contents. If you have a copy of the actual newsletter sent we would love to receive a copy for the archive.


Books Index update from #577 to #608.

Due to receiving notice from the system administor of the computer we have
been sending this Project Gutenberg Newsletter from for the last 5 months,
after losing our account at vmd.cso.uiuc.edu, we have burned things up for
the last day or so and completed all the books for July, 1996, which marks
the end of our 25th year as the oldest Internet information provider: and
which might mark the end of our unofficial relationship at the university.
This account might vanish any time after midnight, as the date suddenly is
June 10 for us leaving this computer.

We are not sure how we will be reaching you after midnight, but we will be
working on as many ways as possible.

We have been assured by some that this account would remain, and by others
that it will be gone by the time you likely read this.

Therefore the 32 July, 1996, 25th Anniversary Project Gutenberg Etexts are
listed below, and should all be available from
uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu in a few hours, if the relay works at 3:00 AM CDT.
We managed to get all but a last one or two ready by the 3:00 PM relay.

For the moment, we strongly encourage all those who have been considering,
or who might consider, the placement of the Project Gutenberg Etexts on an
assortment of systems around the world. We don't place any restriction on
who can place our files where, as long as they don't charge for them: but
most of them are available even for that purpose, without royalties to us,
IF. . .you don't use the Project Gutenberg name which is a TradeMark: and
don't use the copyrighted Etexts, which are clearly marked inside the file
and also with a "C" following the Etext number in our indices.

Obviously, we could use your help more than ever right now in many ways:

1. Keep sending in your suggestions for the books you want to work on, or
that you want us to work on.

2. Make sure you find editions from before 1921, and, if possible, the edition
should be from before 1906, because we may have to delete a few million books
from our list of possible books to do if the laws that are currently proposed
in the US are passed, which it looks as if will be the case, since our
legislators will not talk about it-- this will mean we will have to delete
perhaps a hundred books which are currently available from our US sites.
We have moved many to a new offshore data haven, and are researching their
copyright laws-- if you know of any country with short copyright terms, let
us know!

3. If you would care to make a financial contribution, perhaps to help us
get incorporated as a non-profit 501-3(C) corporation, or if you know a lawyer
who could help, this could well be the best time.

4. Checks should be made out to: "Project Gutenberg/BU," as Illinois Benedictine
College is now Benedictine University, 5700 College Rd, Lisle, IL 60532-0900
[Every penny goes to Project Gutenberg, and I am VERY appreciative of their
great help.]

5. There are a dozen companies selling Project Gutenberg Etexts in the clear
violation of our TradeMark. The only one that supports us is Walnut Creek
CDROM. Email them at info@cdrom.com. There is a new, brand new, I don't even
have a copy yet, edition out, and it may be the last one you can get with
books from 1906 to 1920, if the newer and more restrictive copyrights continue
to be passed.

6. One way or another, I will find a way to answer all mail sent to me at
"hart@pobox.com". . .save a copy, you might have to send twice-- which will
not be pobox.com's fault, but mine, as I may have no way to answer sometimes.
That address currently forwards to this one-- AND to hart@prairienet.org--which
is helping as a stopgap solution, but which probably could not handle all
our traffic.

7. My heartfelt thanks to all who have enjoyed our work over 25 years, and
to all those who have helped us do the work, all over the world as well as
all over the United States. While I fully expect to say hello to you all
again, obviously the day will come when you should not expect to hear from
me any longer, as my life expectancy is not as long into the future as has
been my past with Project Gutenberg. I hope I can encourage you to continue
this wonderful experience.

For all history there has never been enough of anything for us except a supply
of air for us to breathe, and now, for the first time, there has been enough
copies of some books, that everyone for the rest of history can have a copy.

Please don't let this first time for something like this be the last.

I have enjoyed doing Project Gutenberg more than I could ever imagine!!

Thanks for sharing it with me.

Michael S. Hart

If you don't stop them, they will totally eliminate the Public Domain-- and
all information will come through commercial vendors, who each have their
own biases and slants on how they want you to see information.

"Life is an open book test, and they are trying to close the books."

PG NEWSLETTER NOVEMBER 1996

Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

Books Index update from #681 to #704.

Due to the fact that some are much larger than normal, we have also made
up a few that are smaller than normal to even things out a little.

Coming: The Fall of the Roman Empire, by Gibbon and
Interview with Bruce Sterling on his new book, Holy Fire.

Please see the accompanying note entitled Project
Gutenberg Needs You, for details.

Our Spanish readers may read about us in the latest issues of Information
World en Espanol, we are very interested in doing more books in more languages.

You may also want to keep an eye out in about a month for the article on
Project Gutenberg in the January issue of Wired.

Once again we have managed to present 32 files we hope will be of interest
to the general population. We have two more months scheduled for 32 per month--
then we hope to once again double our production, this time to 64 per month--
for each of the 12 months of 1997.

While this may appear as an incredible amount of work, the truth is that
your volunteers at Project Gutenberg have already spend several months doing
books at the rate of 64 per month, during the Spring of 1996 just to insure
that in 1997 we would be capable of accomplishing our goals.

However, while we were doing this, you may have also heard that most supports
for Project Gutenberg from the University of Illinois have been withdrawn
and what you may NOT have heard is that this has also been true of the support
we have been receiving from Benedictine University [Illinois Benedictine
College was their previous name], and also support from Walnut Creed CDROM,
who makes and markets the only official Project Gutenberg CDROM has also
been less of a support than in previous years.

A separate message requesting your individual, college, or corporate support,
is accompanying this Newsletter. . .if you are not interested just delete
it.

We currently have just about #700 volunteers, as is usually the case the
book number is approximately the same as the number of volunteers we have.
A 1997 production on the schedule we have managed to keep doubling every
year should be possible if we receive support on two levels:

1. We will need approximately 800 more volunteers if we are going to produce
800 more Etexts during 1997.

2. We will need approximately $2,000 per month to keep afloat as I am unable
to continue funding Project Gutenberg without financial assistance.

3. We could also use some public relations people, if we can get any for
the next year. We did manage to get one last year, but AOL stole her away.

I thank you all for your continued support of what I feel to be the very
best possible investment you can make in the world. Every book we produce
goes to millions, perhaps even hundreds of millions, of the 1.2 billion computers
out there in the world, and usually there is more than one user per computer.

Your single effort of putting your favorite book into electronic text formats
could change the lives of hundreds of millions of people. . .please help.

My HUGE thanks!

This is probabaly the last Newsletter that is going to the OLD server; at
gutnberg@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu
. . .if you want to delete yourself . . .
there is probably no need, but you should ask me about listproc@ prairienet.org
if you haven't changes your subscription.

Well, my link to uiarchive is finally back up, so the November Etexts should
be on all our major sites, as below, by the time you see this. I am not sure
when the international sites do their mirroring but the US sites should all
be ready to go.

My apologies, many of our links, drive, and computers have been down, all
week long.

My apologies, also, for the fact that the CBC told me my interview would
be on the air on Thanksgiving [Canadien OR American]. . .but they JUST called
and told me it would be on the CBC and PRI tonite at 7:00 PM. . .we get PRI
on PBS. . .Tuesday. . .December 3, 1996.

[Canadian Broadcasting Company/Corporation]
[Public Radio International]
[Public Broadcasting Service/System]

We shall see/hear.

Wired also called today, they now say we are in the February Wired which
should go on the stands in early January. Around page 90.

In response to last month's Newsletter, we have received a moderate amount
of good wishes, and offers of several more computer sites on which to post
these Project Gutenberg Etexts, and hopefully enough legal support to get
us into a "Project Gutenberg, Inc." phase of existence, something I definintely
have an approach/avoidance thing about.

However, it seems that getting any actual financial assistance to keep a
roof over the head of this particular computer, and its cousins, along with
myself . . .might be on the order of having a snowball fight in the nether
regions.

We received about enough money to keep us running for a week.

Please put us on your Holiday gift list. . .information appended.

If you have ANY hope of contacting ANYone at ANY institution that could be
an eventual financial supporter, please let us know. The roof is paid for,
this would only pay for the power, phone, taxes and other utilities.

Once again we have managed to present 32 files we hope will be of interest
to the general population. We have two more months scheduled for 32 per month--
then we hope to once again double our production, this time to 64 per month--
for each of the 12 months of 1997.

While this may appear as an incredible amount of work, the truth is that
your volunteers at Project Gutenberg have already spend several months doing
books at the rate of 64 per month, during the Spring of 1996 just to insure
that in 1997 we would be capable of accomplishing our goals.

However, Etexts and copyright clearances are only barely coming in for the
32 Etexts per month scheduled for 1996, and usually we would be posting the
ones for December right now, rather than for November, so unless we manage
more of getting volunteers, or increasing their efficiency, we might have
to send out only 32 books per month in 1997. . .maybe change our name to
"The Book Of The Day Project."

Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

This is not the newsletter as it was sent out to subscribers, but it is the contents. If you have a copy of the actual newsletter, we would be grateful to receive a copy for the archive.


Books Index update from #737 to #750.

As has been the case for several years now, I try to publish something of
particular interest on the anniversary of the death of my father.

I have received permission to dedicate Project Gutenberg Etext #750 to Professor
H. H. Hart, today, December 10, 1996 on the 7th anniversary of his death.
He was instrumental in bringing Project Gutenberg to an even wider audience
than I could have.

Thanks Dad! The High History of the Holy Graal is for you. . .

Michael

Subject: June Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 4 Jun 1997 18:03:12 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Tuesday June 4, 1997

With this issue we have reached Etext #933, though we were a little
behind all of the month of May, we managed to catch up just in time.

*

Try "transend.com.tw:/mirrors/gutenberg/etext"
We have a new Etext site up and running in Taiwan, and are working,
hopefully to be ready in a month or two, on a site in Australia.

*

We really NEED some serious volunteers who are willing to help with
Etexts in other languages. . .this is VERY difficult for dyslexics,
such as myself, who normally use only Plain Vanilla ASCII programs.

Subject: Project Gutenberg Etexts for June, 1997
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 18 Jun 1997 10:58:15 -0500 (CDT)


This is a very short Project Gutenberg Newsletter announcing June's Etexts

Our prairienet.org fileservers will be down for perhaps a week, starting
on Friday, so we had to get everything posted now, so they would get to
our mirror sites before the downtime.  Our other sites, listed below,
should have them all posted by Friday.

The Lost Pricess of Oz may be missing a page or two, if you have that
book in a paper edition, please let me know, and I will get more info.

I also need to hear from people who can help us proofread Dante in both
Italian and English.

Thanks so much,

Michael S. Hart

Subject: Project Gutenberg's 26th Anniversary Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 2 Jul 1997 13:32:05 -0500 (CDT)

Our email is back up, but our FTP is still iffy. . .see below.


26th Anniversary Edition of the Project Gutenberg Newsletter

July 4th 1971 to July 4th 1997:  nearly 1,000 Etexts online.

We have chosen Howard Pyle's "Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"
as our 26th Anniversary edition, and are still working madly
on Dante's Divine Comedy in Italian and several English text
translations for our 1,000th Etext, which should be released
officially on September 1st.

This is going to be quite an effort, anyone who has not been
in touch with me lately about it, please contact me again.


WIRED magazine's July issue listed Project Gutenberg as part
of their 40 year timeline of the most important events in an
extensive "informed projection" of the causes and effects of
the events of the 40 years surrounding the year 2000 in four
pages of foldout between pages 122 and 127.  The listing for
Project Gutenberg is near the top center of the four pages--
this is a very impressive list to be included in.  **Blush**
[I don't blush that often, but this is impressive! company.]


LOST EMAIL!  If you haven't heard from me, see below.

As announced two weeks ago, Prairienet was down last week to
make upgrades, and I have replied to all of the over 1400 of
your emails that I received over that period, but I know the
fact is that a lot of email is in the bit bucket in the sky,
as our sysadmins put it, so if you have not heard from me, a
resend will be necessary. . .sorry for the hassle.

Our email is now functioning normally but our Prairienet FTP
sites are still not working, none of them, so you would have
to get the files from alternate sites, listed below.

If you are SENDING us files, please use mrcnext right now or
trixie, if mrcnext is down.

We still need more people with SCANNERS. . .please email our
Director of Production, Dianne Bean <beand@pr.erau.edu> if a
scanner is available to you.

We need to find a copy of:
Sir D'arcy Thompson's "On Growth and Form"
1917 Cambridge University, or reprint.
"Geoffrey F. Pawlicki" <geof@netcom.com>


Here is a list of a dozen new releases since the last Newsletter:

Don Quixote is a long book, some 2 million characters, divided up into
over 100 chapters, and we desperately need all the proofreaders we can
possibly get to take a look at this file over the next few weeks.  The
proofreading can be done from any John Ormsby edition before 1922, and
SOME proofing can be done from later editions.

If you can possibly get your hands one of these paper editions we will
help you coordinate your efforts with others, unless you plan to do an
immense amount of work and try to proofread the whole thing.

What we are particularly interested in at first are just missing parts
. . .whole sentences, paragraphs, sections, etc., then more detail.  A
great value can be generated on this particular Etext by a quick look!

Any differences you see should be reported to me at hart@pobox.com and
your efforts will be coordinated by our Director of Production, Dianne
Bean at beand@pr.erau.edu

Thank you SO much for any effort you can put in on this.  I have spent
the entire morning working on this file, after a few days collecting a
wide variety of editions, etext information, etc.  We also hope to see
a few other editions in both English and Spanish very shortly to get a
Spanish Project Gutenberg Team into motion.

Right now I have to switch to Italian and English for the next dozen--
which will be versions of Dante's Divine Comedy.

Again my HUGE thanks to you all!

Subject: Project Gutenberg Etext #1,000:  Dante
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
Date: Thu, 4 Sep 1997 12:01:25 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for September 4th, 1997

Announcing Etexts #997 to #1036


"Never,
in the field of literature, have so many owed so much to so few."


First things first. . . .

THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To all those who have volunteers help to Project Gutenberg, over
more than a quarter of a century and especially to the anonymous
volunteers [at least anonymous for now], and to those who worked
VERY hard with me over the past few days [not to mention months]
to get us from Etext #900 to Etext #1,000 on schedule.

You can be a Project Gutenberg volunteer,  email hart@pobox.com.

*

You might be interested in taking a look at next week's issue of
Time magazine in the Time Digital Section in Point/Counterpoint.
You can see me in my cap and gown holding a stack of 1,000 CDROM
disks that will be able to hold 10,000,000 Etexts in the new DVD
format.  With compression I am told it could be 20,000,000 Etext
files, which would be more books than any library contains.  The
University of Illinois library, in which this picture was taken,
contains only 10,000,000 items in all its branches and is one of
the largest half dozen libraries in the United States.

*

Yes, in rereading this I realize I write in sentences that would
be considered too long by today's standards; please bear with me
as much as possible on this occasion which is quite possibly the
pinnacle of my career [unless we get massive new support we will
not be able to double our production per year ever again].

*

>From our humble beginnings with a single copy of the Declaration
of Independence of the United States now exactly 315 months ago,
the goal of Project Gutenberg has always been to demonstrate how
computers should create a Neo-Industrial Revolution/Renaissance,
through the efforts of a moderate number of people multiplied in
a nearly infinite manner by the power of computers to copy books
with incredible ease, once they are entered into digital formats
readable by common persons with common computers and programs.

Since that day on July 4th, 1971, when there were ~100 people on
the entire Internet, which had just started reaching out from an
infancy of a handful of U.S. West Coast mainframes, each with an
approximate power of modern calculators selling well under $100,
the invention of the personal computer for the common persons by
Woz and Jobs [Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, who eventually would
become known as Apple Computers Inc.] has changed the face of an
electronic generation for the rest of history.

On that very July 4th, 1971, we had to predict the onset of what
would come to be known as the "personal computer" and little did
we know that the Apple II would hit the market before the end of
the 1970's and we have been thankful to Woz and Jobs, Bill Gates
and Gary Kildall & all the other pioneers of personal computers.
The personal computer was a indispensable requirement for us who
wanted to bring a collection of great books to millions/billions
of people around the world.

At that time United States copyright was 28 years, with possibly
28 more years, if certain legal conditions were met.  Most works
were never renewed, so by 1978 we would have been able to print,
so to speak, most works published before 1950.

However, this was also the heyday of the xerox machine, and they
were not going to sit idly by while a new generation of machines
allowed easy copying of nearly anything in two dimensions.  BUT,
instead of trying to enforce the copyright laws, they broke them
by extending all copyrights to 75 years, and eliminating renewal
requirements, much as what had happened in the early 1900's when
the new steam and electric printing presses had made printing so 
inexpensive that Sears could afford to send catalogs to millions
of people for whom this would be the first book they ever owned.

Thus, to drive these new, more efficient publishers out of THEIR
business, the old line publishing lobby talked the U.S. Congress
into to voiding the copyright laws that had stood since founding
the United States, and doubling copyrights from 14 years, with a
possible 14 year renewal, to 28 years, with 28 year renewals.

*THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT!*

Every single time a new publishing technique has promised to get
the common people a home library, laws have been passed to stop,
dead in its tracks, this kind of "Information Age."

>From the first copyright laws, which were designed to eliminate,
most successfully I might add, the presses which were originally
started by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, to the next generation of
copyright laws designed to eliminate, again most successfully, a
rash of "home libraries," published less expensively than modern
[early 20th century] publishers wanted to compete with, to xerox
revolutions and revolutionaries, which were legally stifled by a
new copyright law in 1976, to the most current copyright bill in
the U.S. Congress, which threatens to remove yet another million
books from the public domain because modern day publishers would
be unable to compete with electronic publishing today.

*AT THE START OF THIS CENTURY COPYRIGHTS WERE 14 YEARS, NOW THEY
*ARE THREATENING TO SURPASS 100 YEARS, A PERIOD LONGER THAN WILL
*BE LEGAL FOR ANY CONTRACT TO BE SIGNED FOR [this is why Panama,
*Hong Kong, etc., were leased for just under 100 years].

Information Age???

For Whom???

We hope it will be for you.

Here are the latest 40 Project Gutenberg Etexts

Gutenberg in Portugal and Brasil

Project Gutenberg now has the following mirror site in Portugal,
and a site in Brasil is under construction.  We would VERY much
like to open more sites south of the equator.  If you know some
places we could ask, please let us know.

A note of interest for potential Project Gutenberg volunteers:

XEROX INTRODUCES SCANNER-PRINTER-COPIER FOR HOME USE
Xerox is introducing a $499 machine that combines scanning, printing, and
copying capabilities with easy-to-use software.  Industry analysts don't
expect rival manufacturer Hewlett-Packard to incorporate color scanners
into its products before next Spring.  (New York Times 18 Aug 97)

Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter, October 1, 1997 [to Etext #1057]
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: hart@archive.org
Date: Wed, 1 Oct 1997 10:10:04 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for October, 1997  [ To Etext #1057]


Well. . .we [I] survived the mad rush to get Etext #1,000 online on schedule,
though I must admit I am still at little behind in posting some updated files
and answering yesterday's email. . . .

You will be receiving a separate note detailing Project Gutenberg's goals for
1998, and beyond, which may have some surprises for you.  If you have had the
idea of starting a project in your own country, region, or language, this one
is a message you won't want to miss.

It will be titled:  "Project Gutenberg Needs Your Help!" and should be coming
to you next week.

***

As you will notice below, we are completing our collection of Oscar Wilde and
would like to hear from you if you have any Wilde materials we have not filed
for downloading yet.

In addition, you will notice that we have started releasing Shakespeare, as I
promised we would after Etext #1,000, as individual files rather than only as
the "The Complete Works."  We hope to do several editions, and are forming an
Etext Team specifically for Shakespeare.  Please let me know if interested.

We will also be forming Etext Teams for other specific authors and subjects--
just let me know which you would like.

***

Dianne Bean, our Director of Production, has just moved this week and will be
out of email touch for a while.  Stepping in to help is one of our volunteers
from England, David Price <ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk>, from the University of
Coventry.  David and Dianne will combine to take my place in November while I
am off schmoozing and conferencing on the West Coast, and doing a feasibility
study on the possibilities of moving back home to Tacoma, Washington.  I will
be up and down the coast in November and would love to stop to see as many of
you as possible, just let me know.  I will be spending most of my time in the
Seattle-Tacoma area the first half of the month, and in Silicon Valley and SF
Bay Area starting mid-month.

My Apologies:
Please note:  Due to my somewhat exorbitant efforts to get Etext #1,000 out on
schedule, I accidentally posted 36 Etexts in July, and 40 in August.  This was
pointed out to me in time to fix the August listings, but I just noticed July,
and since it is now to late to fix this easily, I will just remedy this by the
posting of only 28 Etexts labelled as September, to get us on track.  Oops! mh
[PS. . .I may change the month labelling later, but not the Etext name/number.

There are supposed to be 32 Project Gutenberg Etexts released every month.  mh


ELECTRONIC MONOGRAPHS ARE "GREAT ADVERTISING"
As university publishers struggle to find the right business model for
offering scholarly documents online, some early innovators are finding that
making a monograph available electronically can boost sales of hard copies.
The National Academy Press has already put 1,700 of its books online, and is
finding that the electronic versions of some books have boosted sales of the
hard copy monographs -- often by two to three times the previous level.
It's "great advertising," says the Press's director.  The MIT Press is
experiencing similar results:  "For each of our electronic books, we've
approximately doubled our sales.  The plain fact is that no one is going to
sit there and read a whole book online.  And it costs money and time to
download it."  Meanwhile, the Association of American Publishers has set up
a Web site to showcase its new Digital Object Identifier System, which
identifies copyrighted material and links the user to the copyright owners.
http://www.doi.org/overview.html  (Chronicle of Higher Education 12 Sep 97)

[In addition I heard a news report that said books of all varieties have
an average of 28% increased sales, if they are posted on the Internet.]

***

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.

Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter for November, 1997
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Sun, 2 Nov 1997 03:45:44 -0600 (CST)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, November 5, 1977

Below are listed the 32 October PG Etexts, and 4 more to start November.
We will be releasing separate files of the Complete Works of Shakespeare
starting with Etext #1100 and continuing to approximately Etext #1137 to
release our previous single file Complete Shakespeare, as was requested.
We will also be releasing corrected versions of these files and versions
of Shakespeare from other editions in the near future.

Michael Hart will be hard to reach for most of November, please contact:
Dianne Bean and David Price, our Directors of Production, this month, to
get answers to your normal questions.  I am hoping for a deluge of xerox
copyright pages to work on over the holidays, as most of you know I have
a tendency to get a huge amount of work done just after Thanksgiving and
through the rest of the holiday season, so please keep my mailbox filled
with books we can do.  I can usually handle twice as many books over the
holidays, but sometimes there aren't that many to work on.

***

We have been experiencing problems with our listserver, so we are trying
to send this out now, on Sunday, November 2, so we will have time to try
another listserver on Wednesday if this fails.  The only listserver this
effects is the direct subscription to the "gutnberg@prairienet.org" one.
Many of the rest of you should receive this normally even if that list's
recipients do not.  If that one fails again, some of you may receive the
new copy on or after Wednesday, the 5th.

In other notes of interest, I spoke with the Dean of Computer Science of
Carnegie Mellon University, and apparently I should soon receive letters
indicating that Project Gutenberg should be able to continue to operated
from Carnegie Mellon University for three more years and I will continue
on as a Carnegie Mellon visiting scientist for that period.

Therefore, you will also hopefully shortly be receiving email requesting
that you put Project Gutenberg on your Christmas list; donations will be
made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU", P.O. Box 2782, Champaign, Illinois,
61825-2782, the same as before.  If you do not receive this message, you
can hopefully get it by sending email to Dianne Bean, as above, who will
forward it to Greg Newby, who will be running our other listserver tries
while I am away.

A note below these Etext entries indicates that we are updating sites to
our new addresses, around the world, as the old "vmd" address we had for
so many years, will no longer forward to us after another month or so.

If you are still emailing us at any "vmd" address, please update address
books now, and let us know where sites are that contain the vmd address,
OTHER than uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu, and in the Etext files themselves.

This is our second experimental effort at cataloguing multiple
items in a single file.  In the first instance we use the same
index number for each item, and just used multiple entries for
that file in the index.  In this, the second instance, we have
used separate index numbers for the collection and for all the
entries in that collection.  Let us know which you prefer.  We
have traditionally used the smallest number of index entries--
as somewhat of a protest against others who have copied Etexts
and wanted it to appear as if they had more Etext than Project
Gutenberg or various other etext collections.  We want to make
our Etexts as easy as possible to find and work with, but, not
to "pad" our work.  However, we prefer to post short works for
you in collections, to eliminate you having to download all 11
kilobytes of our header and "legal fine print" to get files of
sizes less than the headers. Please email me on this.  Thanks!

My apologies, as the message below indicates; there are a number of very
old Project Gutenberg files scattered around the world and we appreciate
any efforts you could make to help us update them.  Many sites say their
location is the official center of Project Gutenberg, but the truth is a
real center of Project Gutenberg is a more or less mythical thing, as we
have always been an Unlimited Distribution concept, in which anyone will
be allowed to put up a Project Gutenberg site wherever they want as long
as it is non-profit.


Bringing Things Up To Date

As many of you know, Project Gutenberg is the oldest general
information provider on the Internet, having begun in 1971--
when there were only about 100 people on the whole Internet.
Since we allow our files to be reposted anywhere people want
to post them, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of sites
around the world containing our files. . .which we consider,
most whole-heartedly, the best way to provide Public Domain,
and other information, to the world.

However, as many of you Web users know, one of the problems,
probably the biggest problem, with the Web, is that no files
are updated in a given year on surprisingly large numbers of
Web sites, once they have been established.

Therefore, since many of our files date back many years, the
problem occurs that people read files such as "newuser.gut,"
from some of these sites, and receive information about some
of our email addresses and listservers that have been out of
date for years.

Right now, I would ask you to let me know the locations, and
filenames [other than the Etext files themselves, of course]
that we should make an effort to get replaced.  We realize a
number of these locations are not "active" in the real sense
of the word, but we can certainly make reasonable efforts to
at least update the locations we can.

Many of these sites mention "vmd" addresses.  vmd has been a
discontinued service for quite some time now, and if looking
for "vmd" on these sites yields a "hit". . .other than in an
Etext file [which will be updated in a separate effort] then
we ask you to email the people at that site [and cc: us] for
the purpose of asking them to update their files if possible
or to contact us if this can't be easily done.

Thanks for your help!

Happy Holidays to you all!!!

New sites "down under" are carrying the Project Gutenberg Etexts:

The Sydney PC Users Group was formed approximately 10 years ago
to cater to home computer users.  It has currently 2600 members,
prints a monthly magazine called "PrintScreen", & runs Special
Interest Groups (or SIGs) on various topics (OS/2, Windows,
Networks etc), runs a couple of local based groups and 3 BBSs
IBM (61 2 9804 8677), Gateway Mail Exchange (61 2 9984 8022)
and Macarthur (61 2 4628 3722).

Scanning Needed for Balzac Works
We have a volunteer interested in preparing English versions of Honore
de Balzac's works, but volunteers are needed to provide scanned files.
She'd like to begin with _Cousin Betty_, _The Chouans_, _The Wild Ass's
Skin_, or _About Catherine de Medici_ but is prepared to work on others
if they are more readily available. If you can help scan in some of the
materials, please contact Daphne Schor <dschor@erols.com> for details.

I wanted to inform you that Gutenberg-DE (Germany) has moved. The page
you are linking to still exists but it's no longer the home site. The
new URL is http://gutenberg.aol.de (Yes, AOL is sponsoring them!) Thanks

AAP INTRODUCES ELECTRONIC TAGGING SYSTEM FOR INTERNET
The Association of American Publishers, in cooperation with the Corporation
for National Research Initiatives, has developed a "digital object
identifier" system that would make it easier for would-be users of
electronic information to find out about the origin and ownership of the
online material, and about copyright restrictions on its use.  The voluntary
system would enable users to "recognize intellectual property even on the
fastest of highways," says a consultant who helped develop the system.  The
system is designed around a numeric tag that would be embedded in books,
articles and even chapters.  When users clicked on an icon, they would be
transported to the information owner's home page, which would contain
information for obtaining permission to use the work.  The system would be
maintained by a new, nonprofit D.O.I. Foundation, supported by fees from
publishers.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 3 Oct 97)

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.


You can get the Project Gutenberg books via FTP and the Web:

[This site is in Urbana, Illinois, and is quite fast]
ftp uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu or ftp 128.174.5.14
login:  anonymous
password:  yourname@your.machine
cd pub
cd etext
cd gutenberg
[or just cd /pub/etext/gutenberg/etext97] 
cd etext97  [96, 95,94, 93, 92, 91 or 90.  70's and 80's are in /etext90]
get filename  (be sure to set bin, if you get the .zip files)
get more files
quit
 
get GUTINDEX.96 to see all Project Gutenberg Etexts to date.
get GUTINDEX.97 to see current releases.
New files in etext97, of course.

ftp prairienet.org
*** [This is usually the first site they appear in, but is slow]
[This site is in Champaign, Illinois]
ftp ftp.prairienet.org or ftp 192.17.3.4

be sure to type "binary" before retrieving the .zip files!

We are working on several sites "down under" in Australia,
here is a note for those near Sydney.

Subject: December 10th Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 10 Dec 1997 19:11:00 -0600 (CST)

***The Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December 10, 1997**

Some of you may receive this a day later due to shifts in a
major listserver of ours, details are appended below.

CONTENTS:

Shakespeare
Portuguese Etext Team
Yahoo! Internet Life Magazine Site of the Month


For December:

A new release of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare;
which brings us to Etext #1137.  This brings us to 10 times
as many files as we had available just 4 years ago today.

As you may be aware, December 10th has been important to us
in the past, as we posted our 100th Etext on December 10th,
1993--just four years ago.  As promised, we are releasing a
version of this as independent files, so you no longer have
to download the Complete Works of Shakespeare to get any of
the particular plays or poems you may wish to use.

We need Shakespeare volunteers to scan or type and proof
Two Noble Kinsmen and Cardenio, dubious Shakespeare texts.
Please contact: Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>.

*

Please put us on your holiday gift list. . .last year about
this time was the first month we ever received more than we
spent on running Project Gutenberg; details appended below.
It would be nice if we could manage this for two months for
1998, and we will hopefully continue to gain publicity from
the major media that will encourage volunteers & donations.

*

We need xeroxes of the title page [both sides] of the Oxford
Book of English Verse [pre-1923 edition].

*

Would those interested in Edgar Allen Poe let me know.  The
files are mostly ready for final proofreading.

*

In general, those of you who have worried about sending big
amounts of email or snail mail, or being too demanding on a
few of us, now is the time to send in xeroxes, questions or
some other items you were worried might take too much time,
effort, etc., on the parts of our volunteers or myself. The
holidays are traditionally a period when we do huge amounts
of work, and the computers are very fast because others are
off on vacations.

We are also working on a new high bandwidth listserver:  we
have crashed the prairienet listserver several times.  This
is often because people do not notify the listservers of an
email address change, and the number of error messages that
come back is too great for the mailer to handle.  Please do
unsubscribe and resubscribe when moving, even if your gurus
tell you this is not necessary. . .it often is.  A list the
size of 10,000 will often generate 500 error messages which
have wreaked havoc on prairienet.org, so we are moving to a
more robust server, as detailed at the end of this message.

*

Our Portuguese Team is forming up, and anyone interested in
doing Etexts or sites in Portuguese or in translation is an
extremely welcome addition.  Please contact Lucia Segovia:
<lsegovia@mail.telepac.pt> about Etexts in Portuguese:  and
Marco Campos <mcampos@esoterica.pt> about forming sites.

*

"Yahoo Internet Life" magazine has chosen Project Gutenberg
as their "Site of the Month" for January, 1998, in an issue
dedicated to the "Top of the Net."  This issue should reach
the newsstands this week and my advance copy is interesting
in the extreme.  I would suggest taking a look at the whole
thing, and possibly at our article with is the middle at pp
68-69.  Somehow I think our press is getting better, and it
may yet help us keep afloat.

"In the galaxy of Website awards we offer our five stars
just 12 times a year.  Here's this month's in-depth look
at a Web site or service that is truly distinctive. . ."

Also:

As of today, TopTenLinks ranked your web site as one of the
top ten web sites on the Internet! Your ranking can be found
at TopTenLinks  located at:  www.toptenlinks.com

*

I have returned from my month of hobnobbing, with my fellow
wizards on the West Coast and have made numbers of contacts
that should someday provide some help in nearly all areas I
think we need help:  financial, incorporation, more Etexts,
and more computers and scanners.  I will be following up on
these contacts in the year[s] to come, and hopefully make a
variety of new contacts each November to come.  If you have
suggestions for areas I did not include above please let me
know.  Oh, I also made a public relations contact that I am
hoping will get us more publicity.

*

Now, here are the 32 November Etexts, and 17 from December--
we promised that as soon as we had 1,000 Etexts we would put
out individual editions of the Shakespeare works that we had
posted as a single large file as our 100th Etext, four years
ago this very week, and dedicated to my father, who died the
10th of December, 1989, after helping me take one of the big
steps towards getting Project Gutenberg out of this basement
and into a more worldwide mode of circulation.  Thanks Dad!!

Here is a request for help from Donald Knuth.  [Yes, THE Donald Knuth]

Mies van der Rohe was famous for saying "God is in the details";
for example, his obituary in the New York Herald Tribune (1969)
mentioned this. So I tried to find it in his writings; no luck.
[It is of course a wonderfully apropos motto for computer scientists.]

I talked to some architects, and got the following lead, supposedly
quoted from a biography of Mies by Franz Schulze (U Chicago Press, 1985),
footnote on page 281, although Stanford's library doesn't have that book:

More details on request.

>From one of our volunteers searching various libraries for public domain
materials for Project Gutenberg--[Please note that we can only use books
published before 1923. . .due to the U.S. copyright laws. . .but that we
will be posting books in other countries that will be produced there, of
later dates, but which are public domain in those countries.]

"Had a real shocker today, although I imagine it's no surprise to you.  I
spent a few hours digging, only to find that the General Circulation
Section of the Main Branch of the New York Public Library has no public
domain books!!  The closest I came was one 1924 edition of the oeuvres
of some obscure Frenchman - en francais.  Just out of curiosity, I
checked some of the reference section as well, w/ the same result."

We would like to find out where the pre-1924 editions are being kept.

About our efforts to run from a new listserver:

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.

If you care to make a donation to keep Project Gutenberg running,
or to sponsor a particular book, you can donate as follows:

Checks should be made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU" and mailed to:

Subject: Project Gutenberg Volunteers' Newsletter, January, 1998
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Project Gutenberg Volunteers' List" <gutvol-l@listserv.oit.unc.edu>
Date: Thu, 15 Jan 1998 12:07:14 -0600 (CST)

This is the first note to the new Project Gutenberg Volunteer's List.

First let give you a whole new year's worth of thanks for your help!!

Then let me tell you how simple Project Gutenberg really is.

We post our files in such a manner that they are available all over a
whole world of sites [not that we don't need more] the next day.  The
process is called "Unlimited Distribution" through which we encourage
anyone who wants to to repost out books anywhere and any way they are
willing to do so, though we do ask a royalty for commercial usage.


Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually made available in "Plain Vanilla
ASCII". . .a term we created to define these simplistic standards:


Please keep the following somewhere you can refer to it now and then.

This is the REALLY SIMPLE standards file for Project Gutenberg Etexts

1.  Put a blank line between each and every paragraph.  For Mac users
this means each line IS its own paragraph.  For DOS and UNIX users it
means hard returns ending each line--cr/lf--13 0D ^M CR / 10 0A ^J LF
2.  The only markup we use is when emphasis italics or bold are used.
Then we use CAPS for those words.  If only one letter, _I_, _O_, etc.
3.  Margins should be somewhere between 55 and 79 letters per line &
watch out for trailing spaces, which tend to creep in now and then.
4.  Use only the same characters you would use in writing email in a
plain manner. . .higher order characters, accented characters, oe,ae
and all those should be written in the plainest possible manner so a
wider audience can be reached.  We can also post other files, having
all the higher level characters for other languages and characters--
but, we would like to at least post Plain Vanilla ASCII files, too.

The only other aspect of Project Gutenberg Etexts is the header with
the legal provisions required to protect our volunteers and users of
our Etexts from intellectual property hassles and the like.

We would like it if you would put the header at the top of the Etext
files you send in, but if this is a big hassle, we can do it.  These
legalisms have withstood the test of time and were written by a very
competent team of volunteer lawyers expressly for Project Gutenberg.

Some people are having trouble saving these as separate files, so it
will probably be best if I send the header separately, next message,
which you can hopefully save as a file, and import into the Etexts--
don't worry if this is too hard to do, I can do that work in 10 - 15
minutes, but I am becoming aware that I have fewer and fewer periods
of 10 - 15 minutes.  Even if you can't get the headers on the files,
it would still help immensely if you could email me back the headers
with the appropriate data already filled in and I could attach them,
put in the Etext number, etc.

***

A little about Project Gutenberg.

Project Gutenberg is the oldest information provider on the Internet
. . .we started in 1971 by posting the Declaration of Independence a
short time after the University of Illinois got on the Internet with
19 other sites, as the Net finally ceased being an experimental site
cluster near the west coast of the United States.

We have always been volunteers, including myself, though I realize a
few things will have to change if Project Gutenberg is going to head
on into the future without me someday.

We have sometimes been an officially sanctioned part of a university
and sometimes not officially connected with anything.  Our thanks to
Carnegie Mellon University for currently supporting us, and Illinois
Benedictine College, now Benedictine University, for getting us to a
recognizable position on and off the Internet.  While we never had a
position of official sanction at the University of Illinois, we were
undoubtedly the first "Internet Hitchhikers" when we got our account
at the U of I Materials Research Lab, back in 1971, and $100 million
in computer time, to get us started.

For most of our 27 years we have not been officially affiliated with
any institution, though this is been true for only one year of these
last 10 years.  Now that we have posted over 1,000 Etexts, and, have
the support of Carnegie Mellon University, we are more well received
than when the common report was:  "We don't really have to take that
Project Gutenberg thing seriously, they won't be around next year."

However, in the midst of our gained security and respect last year a
doubling of our Etext production last year was forgone due to effort
aimed at just keeping Project Gutenberg going.

Here is the rate at which we have produced Etexts over the years:

32 per month in 1997 for a yearly total of 384 and a total of 1152
32 per month in 1996 for a yearly total of 385 and a total of  768
16 per month in 1995 for a yearly total of 192 and a total of  383
 8 per month in 1994 for a yearly total of  96 and a total of  191
 4 per month in 1993 for a yearly total of  48 and a total of   95
 2 per month in 1992 for a yearly total of  25 and a total of   47
 1 per month in 1991 for a yearly total of  12 and a total of   22
 1 per year before that to a yearly total of 1 and a total of   10

[See 1990 index notes for a description of doing the Bible
and Shakespeare, and the combining of shorter files from a
previous numbering system into the 10 files before 1990.

You should be made aware that computers and networks were pretty
small and slow before the 90's, and that we were not encouraged,
even actively discouraged, from placing large files for download
. . .quite the opposite as today.  Therefore, the first ones are
very small, and we had to originally work on Shakespeare and the
Bible as individual files for each play, poem, or book, so these
files would not overload the systems we were working on then.

***

That more or less brings you up to date and gives you a history,
somewhat abbreviated, of Project Gutenberg.  You will find other
materials about Project Gutenberg on our web site:  promo.net

If you need more supervision than I can provide, please contact,
<beandp@primenet.com> Dianne Bean or <ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk>
David Price, who are our two Directors of Production.  If any of
you are willing to help them supervise some of our volunteers or
teams of volunteers on certain projects, that would be *GREATLY*
appreciated by Dianne, David, and myself.                       
                                                                
Please don't hesitate to ask for more information about all this.

 
Thanks!

Michael

Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter, February, 1998
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: Michael Hart <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 4 Feb 1998 13:58:24 -0600 (CST)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for February, 1998


Milestones to consider:

Etext #1200 posted yesterday. . .possibly #2000 on 1/1/2000

10 years ago we were just posting Etext #12. . . .


We are considering moving to 36 books per month, and, would
like to have your input on this, as I consider this is YOUR
project. . . .  If we do 36 per month for the next 23 month
period, we should be able to reach 2000 Etexts by January 1
of the year 2000. . .however. . .I *am* aware that we would
be pushing things a bit, so I am going to give this at most
a one month trial period, so we can get some feedback.  The
Directors assure me that they have volunteers ready to go--
but I always like to check with out volunteers at large, b4
we change things.  I think it *would* be kind of nice to do
our 2,000th Etext during the big celebration. . . .

[I know that the Third Millennium really doesn't start that
year, but rather in 2001. . .since there was no year zero.]

Here are the 32 Etexts for January, 1998, and if we can get
enough more out in February, I will rename some of them for
January's extra 4 Etexts.  I pushed the envelope yesterday,
and in a fit of the workaholism I am somewhat famous for, I
posted 12 Etexts yesterday, as it is hard for me not to get
going hard when crossing a milestone such as Etext #1200.

The very earliest of our volunteers joined us approximately
10 years ago, when we had only about 12 Etexts in our small
collection. . .though not so small if you consider how long
it took to download them at 300/1200/2400 baud.

Today we have about 100 Etexts available for each Etext the
collection had 10 years ago.  If we can keep growing at the
same rate, we can have a library truly worthy of that name,
10 years from now.

I am not sure how well this is going to work out for me, as
I have been pretty much working as hard as I can for years,
and last year really wore me out.

However, if we can get just a few more volunteer editors in
English and a few other languages, we can do this.

We desperately need at least one editor in these languages:

French
German
Spanish
Portuguese
and other languages
[see list below]


We still need someone to help us create a "hit counter" for
relaying hits to other Etext sources, so they get credited.
This is VERY important for some of them to get grants, etc.


Meanwhile here are the 32 Etexts already posted for January
and below that the ones I posted yesterday for February, of
which 4 may be renamed as for January if we can get 36 more
Etexts on line before the end of the month.

You might be interested to know that Etexts 1198, 99 & 1200
each have their origins down under in Australia.  #2000 was
produced by Sue Asscher from down under in Queensland:  and
the other two are by Australian authors.

We are working hard to set up teams in the languages and/or
countries listed below this index.  We hope you can help!!!

Subject: March Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
Date: Wed, 4 Mar 1998 16:24:31 -0600 (CST)


*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for March 4, 1998


Passing another milestone:


We should be posting Etext #1250 this month, which would be
a total of 1/8 of our goal of 10,000 Etexts on the Internet.


At that time the following will become true:


$1 Trillion Given Away By Project Gutenberg

We have now given away $1 trillion worth of Etexts:  based on Etexts
being nominally valued at $8 each to an average of 100 million users
on the 2 billion computers in the world.

**To avoid the difference between American and other -illions, where
each successive name is multiplied by a million instead of where the
Americans multiply by only a thousand, please use the following:  **

We have now given away $1,000,000,000,000 in Etexts, based on Etexts
being nominally valued at $8 each to an average of 100,000,000 users
on the 2,000,000,000 computers in the world.

In August we should be able to reduce that nominal value to $7, then
next March to $6, and on 1/1/2000 to $5 as a nominal value per book;
and when we finally reach #10,000, it will take only a truly nominal
value of $1 each for Project Gutenberg to have given away a trillion
dollars worth of Etexts, even if we still only reach 100 million for
the average number to use each Etext, out of a world population that
will be between 6 billion and 7 billion, with 2 billion to 3 billion
computers for them to use, perhaps even 4 billion by that time.  The
current world population is now exactly 5.9 billion, as of today; it
should be 6 billion by the time we reach the millennium].


Recently released:

William the Conqueror by E.A. Freeman[Saved #1066][wlmcnxxx.xxx]1066
We wanted to make the obvious connection from year 1066 to book 1066

If you would like to reserve any of the dates between 1225 and 2000,
just let me know.  Example:  something on Columbus for #1492, and on
his later trips, Magellan, etc., for the next few Etexts.

Requests:
Madame Bovary
Emerson
Yeats
Tennyson
Byron
Verne's Off On A Comet
George Eliot's Ramola
20 Years at Hull-House by Jane Addams
Brecht
J.M. Barrie's Little White Bird [First Peter Pan appearance]


We still need someone to help us create a "hit counter" for
relaying hits to other Etext sources, so they get credited.
This is VERY important for some of them to get grants, etc.

GATES SAYS GOVERNMENT ACTIONS HAMPERS MICROSOFT'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE
Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates says that if the Justice Department
prevents the company from adding new features to its Windows software,
Microsoft will lose its ability to remain a technology industry leader.
Gates argues: "It's hard to say that you're going to compromise on your
ability to innovate in Windows.  If I can't put Internet support in Windows,
then Windows will fail. If I can't put speech recognition into Windows,
Windows will fail. You know, our path is to make Windows better.  If we
can't innovate in our products, then you know we will be replaced."
(Washington Post 3 Mar 98)

MICROSOFT SOFTENS POSITION
Microsoft says it is revising agreements with about 12 U.S. and 30 European
Internet service providers to allow them advertise and promote browsers
other than Microsoft's own Internet Explorer.  A company spokesman
explained:  "This change makes sense from a business perspective, and if it
helps to alleviate any potential government concerns, then it's a change
we're happy to make."  (Washington Post 2 Mar 98)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks to all our supporters!!

Subject: April-May Project Gutenberg Newsletter

Date: Thu, 2 Apr 1998 14:11:07 -0600 (CST)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for April and May, 1998

We were set to announce that we were 1/8 of the way to our Etext
#10,000 in this Newsletter, but things went so well this month a
new announcement is in order. . .instead of just reaching 12.5%,
we have reached 13% of our goal as of today, 50 more Etexts than
we had planned to announce today.

The Gutenberg Volunteers have really been on fire lately, with a
record number of 80 Etexts being posted during the last 31 days,
thus requiring a combined Newsletter containing all the titles--
including the two more we posted since the end of March.

There will be our usual "Project Gutenberg Needs YOU!" message--
sometime this month, then, hopefully, we will still be ahead for
getting May done, and thus post the June Newsletter in May.

*

We have versions of Madame Bovary, The Waste Land, and Chroicles
of Avonlea ready for proofreading. . .as per your requests, just
email me to get them.

*

We need to know who sent which files of Count of Monte Cristo,
so we can link up the proper copyright research to the files.

Massachusetts area for June 9-13, within walking distance of Harvard

>From Edupage:

I WANT MY MINITEL!
Almost 20 years ago, France became the first networked nation with the
deployment of the Minitel, a low-tech terminal that citizens could use to do
everything from check the weather to order a pizza.  Now, the country's 35
million subscribers are loathe to give up their beloved Minitel and go
online with the Internet:  "The Minitel... could end up hindering the
development of new and promising applications of information technology,"
warned Prime Minister Jospin last summer, adding that France's technology
gap "could soon have dire repercussions on competitiveness and employment."
To bring the populace up to speed, Minitel owner France Telecom is planning
to deploy next-generation terminals that will access both Minitel and the
Internet, but French Internet-industry executives say such hybrid solutions
merely encourage users to keep thinking "Minitel," rather than "Internet."
"While we sit and worry about the Minitel and ways to get around it, we
could be throwing our whole future away," says one.  (Wall Street Journal 26
Mar 98)

COPYRIGHT SITUATION IN CHINA
Pirated videodisks of the movie "Titanic" were available throughout China
last November, a month before its release in U.S. theaters, and about half a
million pirated disks are smuggled into China every day from Macao.  Chinese
officials say there is little they can do about this blatant violation of
the intellectual property rights agreement that China reached with the
United States in 1995.  One official explains:  "The profits are so great,
they will take any risk.  They're like drug dealers.  It is very difficult
to arrange a crackdown.  You have to coordinate all these different
departments, the copyright publication department, the police, the
Industrial and Commercial Administration.  We take copyright violations very
seriously.  But when it comes to copying a disk, most Chinese people don't
see what's wrong."  And one merchant who sells pirated material insists:
"There's nothing wrong with selling pirated VCDs.  My son loves watching
them."  (New York Times 28 Mar 98)

CULTURE, NOT CURRENCY, MAKES A HAVE-NOT COUNTRY
Digital guru Don Tapscott says whether a nation remains a technology
"have-not" depends on its mindset, not its bank balance:  "It's not the poor
countries that are blocking progress.  It's countries that have a culture
that impedes innovation, that cannot find the national will to go forward
with technology.  What is it about a national culture that enhances
curiosity?  You need countries to have an environment where companies have
the potential to create wealth."  (Upside Apr 98)

"SPAMFORD" WALLACE AGREES TO STOP SENDING JUNK E-MAIL
Sanford Wallace (dubbed "Spamford" for his aggressiveness in "spamming" the
Internet with unsolicited commercial messages) to pay $2 million to settle
the last of several lawsuits brought by Internet providers against him and
his company, Cyber Promotion Inc.  Wallace indicated that legal battles have
"put Cyber out of the spamming business."  (New York Times 29 Mar 98)

Subject: April Project Gutenberg Volunteer's Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: unlisted-recipients:; (no To-header on input)
Date: Mon, 6 Apr 1998 13:58:25 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Volunteers' Newsletter for April


We are hopefully going to be getting a new influx of volunteers
in a few weeks, so I want to get somewhat organized to have the
possibility of finding them people to work with in these areas:


"Raiders of the Lost Art"

This team will be in charge of finding Etexts out there. . .web
sites, ftp sites, etc.  Many of these will be in HTML format in
which some people will have declared they have a copyright so a
team of HTML and unHTML people will have to work closely with a
representative of the Raiders Team to get some or most of these
into Plain Vanilla ASCII Etext format.

If you are at all interested in searching the Net for things or
in unHTML or HTML, please let me know, as we will need you.


We also need volunteers to supervise our new volunteers to make
their startup period as short and painless as possible, from an
introduction to Etext, to file transfer, etc.


We also are working on Etexts in French, German, Portuguese and
Spanish, at the moment, and we hope to have some coming in this
list of languages.


1.  Arabic
2.  Chinese
3.  Danish
4.  Dutch
5.  Esperanto
6.  French
7   German
8.  Greek
9.  Hebrew
10. Hungarian
11. Italian
12. Japanese
13. Korean
14. Latin
15. Lithuanian
16. Polish
17. Portuguese
18. Romanian
19. Russian
20. Slovak
21. Slovene
22. Spanish
23. Valencian [Catalan]

Here are some clips from messages of support we have received
in the last 3 months or so. . .please add my thanks to them!!

I think you are doing a great thing.

I was overwelmed when I viewed this site.  I am still
too excited to type.  Thank you for this undertaking.
I am an avid reader and do not know where to begin.

I really enjoy your project and I think that it's a wonderful
idea to make literature classics available to large audiences.

Thanks for the quick response.  I downloaded it from
an ftp mirror site.  All very smooth.  I admire your work.

April-May newsletter just arrived and I would like to express how much I
and some of my friends here in Istanbul  appreciate your efforts which have
brought the Project Gutenberg in present situation. As one of the most
benefited netizens from Gutenberg, I feel I owe something to it. I do not
know what can I do contribute this project but I have a simple flatbed
scanner and OCR software. I would like to do something, if I knew the legal
(royalty and copyright) situation for the books to be carried into
electronic environment. I thought perhaps you can recommend me a URL which
describes it in details or perhaps there is a document about it somewhere
on the net.

Again, thanks for helping us to have outstanding electronic libraries on
our computers.


I fully support this project and the importance
of what is being accomplished. Bravo to you all!!

My admiration and good wishes.

I am blind and use a screen reading program to access Windows 95, Netscape
etc.  I teach other blind people to use computers for a living, so I've
been experimenting with a lot of web sites.  This search engine is the
easiest one to use that I have ever come across.  Great work!!!

I'd like to thank you for your work in helping to coordinate the
Gutenberg project.  It is one of the best resources on the web today.

Your project is excellent.

Best of luck with your Gutenberg project - it's a great idea.

This is a small token of my great regard for your project.

What a fabulous project.

Thanks for the great work.

Keep up the good work.

And congratulations on what you have done. It is remarkable...

It is impossible to me list all times that Project Gutenberg was useful
to me. I download so may books that I need that is very difficult to me
list them all. PG is really a excellent and incomparable resource to all
people on the Internet.  So, thanks a lot for all your work!

I have the greatest admiration for what you are doing
to make fine literature available to any and all.
You have added a whole new dimension to preservation
and distribution with impact beyond immagination....
WELL DONE!

I have a very high regard for Project Gutenberg
and deeply appreciate the work that you are doing.

Thanks and good luck with the project.

I have enjoyed Project Gutenberg.  Keep up the good work.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Books on the Net serve many purposes.  One of them is for the use of people
who are unable, for any number of reasons, to get out of house on a regular
basis to shop or to go to their library.  Some never go out at all. This is
truly a blessing for this part of our community. Be well and please continue
your good work.

I really like the concept of making books of all kinds freely available.

I would like to take this opportunity to say "thank you" to you
and all who make PG possible.
I am totally blind.  The one sorrow related to my blindness has
been the problem of actually owning books.  Braille is
wonderful, but it is expensive and bulky, when one can find
books to buy.  Recorded material is easy to store, but often
hard to find for purchase, except for abridged books put out by
commercial companies.
Can you imagine my joy when I discovered PG.  There are my dear
old friends, many dating back to childhood, just waiting for me
to download, and read again and again.  I am a professional
writer, and a teacher of blind children, so you can imagine how
much books mean to me professionally as well as personally.

I greatly appreciate you starting PG, and feel it is probably
the only thing in the computer world that will not only survive,
but will appreciate rather than depreciate with time.

Thanks for hosting this site.  I have
derived good hours of reading from it.

I love the site and what you are doing. Its truly amazing.

I have being quite interested in PG since 5 years ago when I read about it.
Glad to have found your site.

Thanks, and Salutations to you on your noble project,

An hour ago I discovered your work on the Internet ! Just the list of
titles deserves a Million THANKS , I'll take the risk of sounding corny:
I had tears in my eyes by the time I was half through !

I saw a review of your work in Yahoo's Internet Life.
I was quite impressed.

Thanks to all concerned with this wonderful contribution to
our Internet and immortal writers in the public domain.

Thank you very much for the Gutenberg Foundation.

Great site.  I've been looking over the web search engines for months.
Your service and the links on your site are the only places I have
actually found to download literature.  I plan to visit here often.

Obviously your work is an example of the true value
of the technology age.  (But, this you know!)

I have found the Gutenberg Project to have been of enormous worth.
You have helped me find texts in their original form, instead of the
difficult to read and assemble texts found elsewhere on the Internet.
Thanks for all you do, and keep up the good work!

I have been downloading texts for reading from PG for a couple of years now
and I love it.  I have always been intrigued by the low cost, and breadth
of the materials that are becoming more and more available as texts.

Thanks for a great web site!

I admire and fully support your project. Bravo!

Thanks for your help, and keep up the good work.
It is a great site, and a tremendously worthwhile project.

I think it is a GREAT idea!!

First of all: CONGRATULATIONS!!! Ever since I heard about your
project I was very interested and downloaded many of your precious
files and had a good time with them! THANKS FOR THAT!!!

You are doing such great work with the e-texts.

Thanks for all the work you've done!

Wonderful idea, especially, according to the paper,
The Philadelphia Inquirer, your insisting about plain ascii text.

Please keep up the good work.  I have found Project Gutenberg to be
a wonderful and useful idea.  I sincerely hope that the legislation
in the Senate does not get passed to hamper your efforts.

I have told many people about project Gutenberg and
I hope this project continues for many years to come.

I applaud your accomplishments, and admire your initiatives.

Thank you for the Gutenberg Project!!!!!!
Thank you again.  I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to be able to
"look" up a word or definition for myself.  All the best to you.

Just to encourage the great labor you are doing !

I had the pleasure to visit your site/library, and I found it extremely
interesting - my congratulations for the work you've done and still doing.

First of all, I would like to say that I love the Project Gutenburg
archives.  I have downloaded 93 e-texts so far, and I am still
downloading more.  Thank you for providing the texts at no charge.

I have enjoyed some of your books in etext.
Thanks for all your efforts.

Thanks for the work of the Project.

Well this is my first trip to Project Gutenberg and I think that what is
done here is a good thing, and kinda justifies the exsitance of the web
(I know there are a lot more other worth while causes being pursued in the web
but they are over shadowed by other more commercial and perverse activites)
The simple idea is that you people are doing a good deed and keep it up.

I approve wholeheartedly of your efforts.
Thank you and bravo for your project.

Keep up the good work!

I wish you the best and thanks for your efforts.

Thank you for this wonderful asset.

Best wishes for this admirable endeavour.

The Gutenberg Project is a *great* idea!
Thanks for all the work of the team.

Thank you for your wonderful work to date.

First of all I would like to congratulate you for the work you are
developing with Project Gutemberg due to the difficulty it involves.
[From Spanish, I think.  Remember, in many languages is it Gutemberg]

Well, I first found out about the Project Gutenberg a few years ago,
and I've been hooked ever since!  I went from downloading a few files,
to a few dozen files, to a year's worth, etc.  :-)

First, let me congratulate you on Project Gutenberg
and the amazing number of etexts available!
I have only recently been introduced to PG,
and have been madly downloading all the etexts available.
Again, I am astounded at just how much is available!

Good luck with your program!

Thanks for Project Gutenberg!  It's one of the noblest efforts
conceived on the net, and I've long wanted to be a contributor!

Many thanks for an effort that, a thousand years from now, may be remembered
along with Carnegie's philanthropy and the library of Alexandria.

I have been able to reread - thanks to your project, and may I say with
much pleasure, and a deep sense of gratitude - texts that I had never
thought I would be able to relish again in this lifetime!

What a thrilling project!

I appreciate your work.

Keep up the good work.

I have long been a fan of Project Gutenberg.

Thank you for E-Text on the internet.

I have followed your progress for a few years (been on internet
since the foggy past of 1992) and have always thought that it was
one of the best things available.

When I first encountered Project Gutenberg about 5 years ago, I was
mightily impressed and sent in a small contribution.  Now, I am
delighted to see that all is still well.  I shall write about the
copyright situation to my legislator, but most of all, I simply
wanted to go you what a fine thing I think you are doing.

I think Gutenberg is a great project - thanks for all of the work!

Since I first discovered Project Gutenburg, the idea of electronic books
that are free and only take up a minimal amount of disk space has
fascinated me. I have always greatly admired the effort.

Thank you for beginning this breathtakingly ambitous process.

I, like so many others, am terribly impressed with the work
you've done on Prject Guetnberg.  It is a great service.

The Gutenburg Project is excellent.

How great it is that yall are doing this because i have found some books
that are very rare that i just want to read but have not been able to
find any other way.

This site is amazing.

Keep up the good work.

And a few clippings from Edupage:

13 STATES TO FILE ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT
Thirteen states are preparing to file a joint antitrust action against
Microsoft to prevent the company from shipping its new Windows 98 operating
system software.  The attorneys general said they would rather have
coordinated a federal-state action against Microsoft, but that they were
concerned over the slower time frame within which federal government
operates.  Microsoft plans to begin shipping Windows 98 to computer makers
next month and to release it to the general public in June, and the states
felt taking any action after the PC makers began installing it on their
machines would be significantly more complicated.  Microsoft's VP for law
and corporate affairs says:  "This case involves a fundamental principle for
us, the freedom of high-technology companies to continue to innovate on
behalf of our customers.  Part of innovation has to be integration.  We are
going to continue to integrate products."  (New York Times 30 Apr 98)


DON'T BLOCK WINDOWS 98, SAY VENDORS
Twenty-six computer industry executives, including the chairmen of Intel
Corp., Micron Electronics, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and
Hewlett-Packard, have signed a joint letter urging the Department of Justice
not to block the planned release of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system.
"Interfering with the release of Windows 98 would drag down the entire
industry's efforts to deliver value to customers and returns to
shareholders," said the letter.  The executives were careful to point out
that they weren't expressing "any opinion on the merits of the investigation
of Microsoft."  The upgrade is expected to be shipped to computer makers in
mid-May and hit retail shelves on June 25.  "The bottom line is, no computer
manufacturer can afford to harm their relationship with Microsoft," says the
president of the Software Publishers Association.  "When Microsoft calls and
asks them to write a letter to Justice, they're hard-pressed not to."  (Los
Angeles Times 1 May 98)


U S WEST TO OFFER TV, INTERNET ACCESS OVER PHONE LINES
For a cost "comparable" to the monthly fees charged by Cox Communications
(the primary cable company in Phoenix), U S West plans to offer its Phoenix
customers a video and data services package via "variable digital subscriber
lines," or VDSL.  U S West says its service will include some 120 TV
channels and Internet access.  In the past year, cable companies have begun
to offer Internet access as part of their monthly service, and an analyst
with International Data says, "If you're a phone company, you're going to
want to roll out a package of services that will blunt the attack from the
cable companies, which are trying to take away phone customers." (Wall
Street Journal 20 Apr 98)

SCIENTISTS DEMO INTERNET EXPRESS LANE
Scientists at two national laboratories demonstrated a new "differentiated
service" technology that gives certain types of electronic data higher
priority for transmission over the Internet.  In the demo, two
streaming-video signals were sent -- one with a high-priority mark and one
without -- over an especially busy Internet route.  The video marked
high-priority arrived at a speed of eight frames per second, versus one
frame per second for the unmarked video.  Within a year, it may be possible
for research labs and universities that need more dependable Internet
connections to pay a higher cost for prioritized delivery.  (Chronicle of
Higher Education 1 May 98)

[This is something we have written about before. . .it basically is like
a railroad system in which efficiently sendable text files are held over
to sidings to wait for movies and sound files to pass on express lanes--
the idea is that it is more important to move huge audio/video files for
entertainment than to move books for education.  Huh??  Michael S. Hart]

Here are the 36 July Etexts for 1998.  The Federalist Papers tops the list to
commemorate the 27th Anniversary of the first Project Gutenberg Etext, the US
Declaration of Independence.  Since we are currently two months ahead of this
year's schedule, we are posting most of these books in June, so they would be
currently arriving at the best time for people to include them in some of the
4th of July celebrations, and also Bastille Day.  Therefore the month of June
will primarily be filled with "History of Democracy" Etexts, as was our first
10 years at Project Gutenberg.  We hope you will find them enlightening.

These Etexts are from  http://www.constitution.org/liberlib.htm
Our Thanks to The Constitution Society for Providing This Etext!

SENATE PASSES ONLINE COPYRIGHT EXTENSION
The Senate unanimously approved the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
offers the same protection to online computer software, music, movies and
written works that they enjoy in more tangible form.  In a key provision,
the legislation exempts libraries and online services from prosecution for
copyright violations committed by patrons and customers.  Individuals who
violate copyrights for financial gain will be liable for $1 million in fines
and up to 10 years in prison.  (Wall Street Journal 15 May 98)

INTERNET GROWTH
A study by the U.S. Commerce Department ( http://ecommerce.gov/ ) says that
traffic on the Internet is doubling every hundred days and predicts that
electronic commerce will grow to $300 billion a year by 2002.  (USA Today 16
Apr 96)  [So. . .anyone who says they can make the Internet 100 time faster,
will have to deal with the fact that traffice with double as fast as they do
any doubling of the speed.  Don't expect any real speedups.    Michael Hart]

[Note Well:  This means traffice is multiplying by 10 every year. . . .
When you listen to those people promising to make the Internet run 100
time faster in 10 years, ask them if the Internet won't be slowing down
because they aren't proposing increasing the speed as fast as traffic.
None of them are saying they could possibly make the Internet handle
100 times more traffic every year. . . .  This is smoke and mirrors.

ECONOMIST PREDICTS Y2K PROBLEM WILL CAUSE RECESSION
In an op-ed piece, Edward Yardeni, chief economist and managing director of
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell says that problems arising from the Year 2000
computer glitch could cause a major recession, as businesses fail and
government agencies become incapable of delivering basic services, including
tax collection, welfare payments, national defense and air traffic control:
"The likely recession could be at least as bad as the one during 1973-74,
which was caused mostly by a disruption in the supply of oil.  Information,
stored and manipulated by computers, is as vital as oil for running modern
economies.  If information is harder to obtain, markets will allocate and
use resources inefficiently.  Market participants will be forced to spend
more time and money obtaining information that was previously available at
little or no cost...  Furthermore, a 2000 recession is bound to be
deflationary.  The U.S. may experience a $1 trillion drop in nominal GDP and
a $1 trillion loss in stock market capitalization."  (Wall Street Journal 4
May 98)  [and you heard it here first, years ago. . .mh]

NEW DOS IS YEAR 2000-COMPLIANT
IBM has launched a new PC DOS 2000 that automatically corrects the two-digit
dates that threaten to befuddle older computer systems, and also supports
the European Monetary Union's new euro currency symbol -- a management
problem that could prove even more troublesome for European businesses than
the Y2K problem.  According to recent research, there are between 120
million and 150 million people who still use DOS on their desktop machines.
"We believe about half of those are business users," says a manager at IBM's
Network Computing Software division.  That figure doesn't include users of
Microsoft Windows 3.1, which includes DOS as a component.  (InternetWeek 27

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we

that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Subject: Project Gutenberg July Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: me@prairienet.org
Date: Wed, 1 Jul 1998 16:18:19 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for July 1998

Our 28th Internet Fourth of July! Congratulations to a
thousand volunteers who have helped us over the years!

[Usually delivered the first Wednesday of each month.]
[Major crashes this week, let me know if you have NOT!
received expected email from me, or if you did not get
this through the normal channels you usually get mail]

***

We are currently working on our first Etext to be sent
in both Chinese characters and in English translation.

It is the story of Mulan; for those of you who want to
use the movies to extend your children's reading, this
is a prime example. . .and to show that not all we see
originated in the language we see it in.

***

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars In Etexts Yet???

This first week of July, 1998, marks the completion of
our 27th year of public information service on the Net
since we started on the 4th of July, 1971, with the US
Declaration of Independence, with a goal to present to
the public 10,000 Etext files for free downloading.  I
am proud to announce that our volunteers have just now
reached 1/7 of that goal, and that we hope we can post
enough more Etexts this year to reach 1/6 of 10,000.

Next year we hope to reach 1/5 of that goal, by giving
away Etext #2000 on or before January 1, 2000.

So. . .right now you would have to value each Etext at
$7, and presume the average Etext will reach 1.687% of
the world population to presume we have given away the
trillion dollars worth of Etexts that is our goal.

When the world population is 10 billion [only just now
reaching 6 billion, but I remember when it was 2.5] it
will only take reaching 1% of the population with that
mythical average Etext, and with 10,000 Etexts it will
only require a nominal $1 value per copy to say we had
given away a trillion dollars worth.

However, since no one else is even PRETENDING to do it
. . .we are still likely to be the first to say we had
a trillion dollar philanthropy project.

Date: Wed, 5 Aug 1998 17:11:14 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, August 5, 1998
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]

Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
New sites going up in Brazil and Australia, as below:  Africa needed!!

***

We should be posting Etext #1500 in a few weeks, and we would like your
suggestions for possible titles to use for #1500.  One suggestion is to
start our new Public Domain Edition of Shakespeare then, with #1500 but
I had #1600 in mind for that, to coincide with the average dates of his
major publications, but that is not at all cast in stone or electrons--
as we have requests for some of the dates surrounding #1600 as follows:

The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, O.T. Part 2 [2drvbxxx.xxx]1610
The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, O.T. Part 1 [1drvbxxx.xxx]1609
The Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, N.T.        [3drvbxxx.xxx]1582
Holy Bible, Douay Rheims Version, Both Testaments [0drvbxxx.xxx]1581

So. . .your suggestions would be MOST welcome, on these titles or on
other titles you might have in mind that could possible be done by a
month from now.

***

We also have a number of requests for help from some of our Directors
and other major volunteers.

New Project Gutenberg mirror sites:

Please try our newest sites in Australia:
http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/gutenberg/
ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/gutenberg/

and

http://www.library.adelaide.edu.au/etext/pg

Since I last wrote to you, I've made a number of improvements to the mirror:

1. There's a search option, whereby users can enter one or more search
terms, and use boolean and/or, to locate texts.

2. There's a list by author for those who want to browse.

3. The user can select (generally) between text and zip formats. Only one
format is stored, to save space, but conversion to the other is done
on-the-fly when requested.

I've also created a USMARC-format catalog, which is used for searching.
This is still a long way from being something that Librarians would not
sneer at, but provides brief-entry records for the texts. I built this from
the GUTINDEX.ALL list, followed by (too many) hours of manual editing. You
can view the result at:

electronic books. It's called VirtualStore

INFORMATION AGE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS
Asked about the impact of computers and the Internet on society, Vanderbilt
University management professor Donna Hoffman says:  "Will we really
transform society through the use of computers and the Internet? Well, the
jury is still out.  I certainly think the potential is there, but it will be
realized only if we can get access in the hands of everyone.  Otherwise, we
are not likely to see revolutionary changes.  And we will still have the
schisms and chasms in society where there will be sectors of society in
which people are able to partake of the wonderful riches online, and at the
same time other groups are effectively excluded.  I don't think there will
be much evidence of the transforming powers found in creating new sources of
value until we have people online who we never thought would come online.
If we're serious about change, we need to be thinking of getting entire
countries -- the developing countries and societies -- online.  (Exec Sum 98)

MIT'S MANAGEMENT SCHOOL SAYS NO MORE PAPER APPLICATIONS
MIT's Sloan School of Management says it will no longer accept paper
applications, opting instead for a fully electronic application process.
School officials say the move will save thousands of dollars in processing,
printing and postage costs, plus hundreds of hours of staff time.  The
school will, however, stick with snail-mail for the back end of the process
-- acceptance and rejection letters will be shipped via the U.S. Postal
Service.  (Investor's Business Daily 4 Aug 98)

FCC TO HOLD HEARINGS ON DISPARITIES IN TECHNOLOGY ACCESS
The Federal Communications Commission will hold hearings this fall to try to
determine why minority groups are less likely to have telephone service or
own a computer than white families.  A U.S. Commerce Department reports
indicates that 96% of white households have basic phone service, compared to
about 86% of black households and Hispanic households;  similarly about 41%
of white families own a computer, compared to about 19% of black and
Hispanic families.  FCC chairman Bill Kennard says, "Does this gap in access
to technology matter?  You bet it does.  How can you look for a job without
a phone?  How can you demonstrate that you have the skills to compete if you
don't know which side of a diskette goes in first?"  (AP 3 Aug 98)
[More on the same story, with a little better statistics:  I counted as one]
STUDY SHOWS WIDENING GAP IN COMPUTER OWNERSHIP
A new study by the U.S. Commerce Department shows that PC ownership among
all Americans grew by 52% between 1994 and 1997, with a penetration of 36.6%
of U.S. households.  But although penetration among blacks and Hispanics
grew faster than the overall rate, the disparity between them and white
households actually widened during that period.  At the end of 1997, 40.8%
of non-Hispanic white households owned a PC, compared to 19.4% of Hispanic
and 19.3% of African-American households, a gap of 21.5%.  In 1994, the
Commerce Department reported a gap of 16.8%.  The study also found that
whites were much more likely to subscribe to an online service than either
blacks or Hispanics.  "The study exposes a growing problem in our economy,
one that must be taken seriously:  too many Americans are not able to take
part in the growing digital economy," says Commerce Secretary William Daley.
"The growing trend of information 'haves' and 'have-nots' is alarming."
(Miami Herald 31 Jul 98)

RIOTS FOLLOW BRAZIL'S SALE OF NATIONAL PHONE SYSTEM
Brazil's national phone company Telebras has been sold for almost $19
billion in the largest privatization deal in Latin American history -- a
deal dominated by Spain's Telefonica, Portugal's Telecom, and the U.S.
company MCI.  Police used tear gas, batons, and a water cannon to control
thousands of angry demonstrators fearful that foreign owners of phone
services will ignore the needs of the Brazilian poor.  (Washington Post 30

***We don't usually include the following, but due to request:


Most people start with surfing to promo.net to get the Guteberg Etexts...

There are many sites around the world containing Project Gutenberg Etexts,
only two of which we actually maintain directly:  prairienet.org and also
archive.org.  uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu mirrors prairienet at 3AM & 3PM, and
is a much faster site.  You may find that some of these sites are faster,
much faster, from you location, but you may also find that some sites are
easier for you to use, depending on how you like to search our collection
of electronic book.  Of course, you can always download GUTINDEX.* files,
and do you own searching with your own favorite program.  That's my way!!
But many people really like the indexing and added information available,
especially from promo.net and sailor, as below.

Our major web site is promo.net, which links to get you the books and....

We are now testing a new site at...
www.thalasson.com/pjb/gtn/index.htm

Many more below, some will be faster for you than others further away.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.

PC PRICES PLUMMET
The price for a home PC, which broke the $1,000 mark just 18 months ago, is
now tumbling below $400 -- well within the reach of the average U.S. family.
Micro Center, an Ohio-based chain of 13 stores, began selling a $399 PC
under the Power Spec label earlier this month, and PrecisionTec LLC, a PC
maker based in California, has introduced its Gazelle machine for the same
price.  The low prices don't include computer monitors, which usually start
at about $150.  Analysts at ZD Market Intelligence are saying the low prices
will spark a surge of PC-buying among households with incomes of less than
$30,000 -- a segment that so far has been difficult to reach -- and that PC
penetration should reach close to 50% of U.S. households by the end of the
year.  (AP 21 Aug 98)

SEC SCOLDS COMPANIES ON Y2K DISCLOSURE
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement last week chiding
companies for their lack of candor in disclosing Year 2000 problems to their
stockholders.  "While the number of companies disclosing year 2000 issues
has increased dramatically, many companies are not providing the quality of
disclosure that we believe investors expect."  The SEC has posted a document
on its Web site, <http://www.sec.gov>, that compares "meaningful Y2K
disclosure" with "boilerplate Y2K disclosure," but an agency task force
recently found that most companies have opted for the latter, just inserting
some meaningless legalese into their financial reports.  (Los Angeles Times
3 Aug 98)

THE BLOATWARE DEBATE
A 100-company survey by Standish Group International found that 45% of a
software application's features are never used, 19% rarely used, 16 %
sometime used, 13% often used, and 7% always used;  yet, in spite of the
fact that most of an application is seldom  used, software gets bigger all
the time.  For example, Windows went from 3M lines of code (Windows 3.1) to
14M lines (Windows 95) to 18M (Windows 98).  Booze, Allen & Hamilton chief
information officer Roger Walters is one of the people complaining now about
this "bloatware" phenomenon:  "My problem is, I'm forced to upgrade all the
time -- not for functionality I want, but for features someone wanted for
me."  But industry analyst Jeffrey Tarter defends the software makers by
noting:  "I can't think of a single lite version of any product that has
ever succeeded.  It may be inelegant and sluglike, but bloatware sells."

INTEL CATCHES FLAK FOR WEB ADVERTISING TACTICS
In an effort to sell higher-power computer chips, Intel is sponsoring an
"Intel Inside Optimized Content" program that encourages Web sites to use
dense, complicated graphics that slow down a computer's processor when the
pages are downloading from the Internet.  An accompanying message tells the
user that a Pentium II microprocessor would speed up the process.  Intel
normally reimburses PC makers 50% of their Web-based advertising costs if
the ad sports an "Intel Inside" logo, but ups its contribution to 75% if the
site uses complicated graphics and includes wording that says the page could
be better viewed using a Pentium II processor.  "It's a hell of an
incentive," says one Web editor.  "PC companies are going to advertise on
sites where they pay only 25% of the costs, as opposed to sites where they
have to pay for half of the ad."  But the innovative tactic has raised the
ire of some Web site owners:  "What they're asking us to do is turn our
sites into a demonstration of their products," says a senior VP at IDG,
publisher of Computerworld magazine.  "We're going to optimize our content
for our readers, not for Intel."  (Tampa Tribune 17 Aug 98)

Subject: October Project Gutenberg Newsletter [Early Edition]
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Tue, 15 Sep 1998 15:32:16 -0500 (CDT)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, October 7, 1998
[This issue is being sent half a month early, we are doing wonderfully]
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

***

In the period since our last Newsletter went out only two weeks ago--
the Project Gutenberg volunteers, directors, and myself, have managed
to double our expected production over the past two weeks since a new
Newsletter was sent out with the index of the December Etexts. . . .

We are currently about 100 Etexts ahead of the schedule we started at
the beginning of the year, and if our usual October recruitment of an
assortment of new volunteers is at all successful, we may be capable,
barring unforseen incidents [such as one week's crashes of two of our
major relay points for our directors files] we may be able to get out
enough Etexts this year to do three or four months ahead of schedule.

We hope this will encourage some of you who have considered doing one
of your favorite books for the rest of the world to use and enjoy; if
you can't wait until our semi-annual "Project Gutenberg Needs You" in
two to three weeks, please don't hesitate to contact me now. . . .

My congratulations to all of our volunteers and directors!!!

Well Done!!!

***

Some of you who have been with Project Gutenberg for years and years,
and there are a few such persons, will recall that we once had a much
more hopeful schedule, and that we are not likely to reach #10,000 by
the end of 2001, unless we achieve some kind of co-operation with the
various other Etext producers around the world, and perhaps get a bit
more funding. . .however, it is not outside the realm of possibility.

As many of you know, there was little or no funding for myself or the
Gutenberg Project during the year ending about 1 1/2 years ago, and a
schedule revision was necessary. . .we had hoped to continue doubling
our Etext output every year, as we had done since around 1991:  which
would have been a schedule that looked something like this:

1024 per month in 2001
 512 per month in 2000
 256 per month in 1999
 128 per month in 1998
  64 per month in 1997
  32 per month in 1996
  16 per month in 1995
   8 per month in 1994
   4 per month in 1993
   2 per month in 1992
   1 per month in 1991

Which would have allowed us to easily reach our goal of 10,000 Etext
by the end of 2001, which was our 30 year plan for Project Gutenberg

However, we were forced to stop our growth for a while, and just get
things to keep rolling along for a while, and thus created this:

42 per month in 2001 would reach a total of 3,333
42 per month in 2000
36 per month in 1999 would reach a total of 2,000
36 per month in 1998
32 per month in 1997 reached a total of over 1,000
32 per month in 1996
16 per month in 1995
 8 per month in 1994 reached a total of about 100
 4 per month in 1993
 2 per month in 1992
 1 per month in 1991
 From 1980-1990 we completed our first Bible and Shakespeare,
 but due to the new copyright extensions, the Shakespeare is
 still not able to be released.  Thus our total was 10 Etexts
 We counted Shakespeare and The Bible as 1 Etext each
 1 per year in 1971-1979 completed our first 9 Etexts
 which were mostly a "History of Democracy"

So much for all that for now. . .more next month, along with
the Etexts, of course, which are our primary objective. . . .

To: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Sun, 27 Sep 1998 12:59:52 -0500 (CDT)


This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Wednesday, November 4, 1998

[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]

[As previously reported, we WERE going to send this out on October 7th
. . .the first Wednesday in October. . .but we are even a little ahead
of that schedule. . .so we are planning this for Wednesday, October 0,
which is really September 30th.  However, prairienet.org, from which I
mail from, will be down Monday, and perhaps Tuesday, so we have to get
everything mailed out before that scheduled upgrade. . .which means we
are actually posting three Newsletters during the September calendar.]

Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Here are three addresses you can email:

hart@pobox.com
[which forwards to]
hart@prairienet.com
hart@archive.org
I would try them in that order.

Project Gutenberg Milestones


We Are Now On All Seven Continents

Our newest Project Gutenberg site is at:
ftp://ftp.is.co.za/text/project-gutenburg/
Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa
This site is FTP only, which most new browsers can handle.
If you need help working with this particular site, email:
'The Internet Solution FTP admin' (ftp-admin@is.co.za)

It has been a greater struggle than you might imagine,
getting sites up in South America, South Africa, and
Australia, but we are now connected!  Our goal is to
have all the Project Gutenberg Etexts easily available
where they are legally in the public domain.  If you
seen any that should not be where they are, please
email me and the site where they are so we can fix it.
If you know of any places that would be willing to put
up mirror sites, or just some of our books, please let
me know, or even if they are willing to put the Etexts
up for download at physical locations.  The more ways
people have of getting books, the better.

***

This is obviously the first time we have posted three Newsletters from
dates in the same calendar month, which should bring you approximately
100 Etexts for your collections this month.  The numbers total 108 but
we have reserved several numbers for Etexts that probably will not get
posted by the time we send this.

I would like to take this opportunity to give my HUGE thanks to all of
the volunteers and our directors, who have been totally outdoing their
normal production for the past two months, and on the new Shakespeare!

During October we plan to post the normal number of 36 Etexts and also
to start on both our new public domain Shakespeare and our revised one
that will update Etext #100 with many corrections.

If we succeed in posting the new Shakespeares, and in doing 36 Etexts,
we should have posted 1667 Etexts by the end of October or November; a
little uncertain as to when the Shakespeares will actually get posted.

This will bring us to 1/6 of our original goal of 10,000 Etexts and we
can reduce our trillion dollars given away price to $6 per Etext if we
manage to give the average Etext to 100,000,000 people.  That's one of
those American trillions. . .not the much bigger kind!. . . .  Another
year and we can reduce that price to $5 per Etext to give $1 trillion,
when we reach for Etext #2000.  We need suggestions for what book will
be #2000.

***

We will be sending out our October "Project Gutenberg Needs You" note,
probably in a week or two. . .but no need to wait to volunteer.

We will be spending much of October and November training volunteers--
so we probably will not be able to keep up this kind of schedule. . .a
guess, however, is that we will still end up about three months ahead,
by the time 1999 actually begins.

***

Just in hours before sending this out:

Around September 8th, our site at Sailor reached the half million
Etext mark for 1998 and expects to reach between 3/4 - 1 million
by the end of the year. . . .  They tell me this is more books
than the average big city library checks out in a year, so let's
also send more people to the libraries; and the librarians, who
are worth their weight in gold!

sailor.gutenberg.org or 198.76.201.198 in Baltimore, MD.
This site provides very fast service for both WWW and FTP service.

***

Oh, I forgot to mention, WIRED is scheduled to have something
about us in their November issue, coming out in about two weeks.
[Usually around the 7th of the month or so]

***

Here are the 36 Etexts for Februray, 1999, including 4 from March.

>From Edupage:


UNIVERSITIES PUSH PROFESSORS TO RETAIN COPYRIGHTS
There's a growing movement among academicians and their institutions to
retain the copyright on articles published in scholarly journals, rather
than turning those rights over to the publisher as is usual.  The California
Institute of Technology will be hosting a three-month-long discussion of the
subject on an electronic network, beginning Oct. 1.  "It became clear to
me," says Caltech provost Steven Koonin, "that copyright is the linchpin. If
you're going to change that system, copyright is the nexus that you have to
go after."  Other universities now considering turning the tables on
publishers include Yale University and the University of Kansas.  Koonin
says he'd like to see Caltech and its faculty members jointly own the
copyrights to journal articles and license those rights to publishers on a
limited basis.  "The publishers have basically been getting a free good up
to this point -- which is the copyright."  Meanwhile, publishers are not
enthusiastic about the movement, and an Elsevier Science VP says she has
"serious reservations" about a university policy that would require its
professors to retain their copyrights.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 18
Sep 98)

THE CHECK IS STILL IN THE MAIL...
More than 47.4 billion business and personal checks were printed last year,
up 1.4% from 1996.  "Checks are a U.S., Canada and U.K. phenomenon," says a
Citibank VP.  "In the U.S., having more than 12,000 banks and savings and
loans makes it hard to agree on electronic standards, which encourages
checks."  Not only that, but banks benefit from selling all those checks, to
the tune of $1.7 billion last year -- that doesn't include the additional $1
billion they made charging for bounced checks.  And issuing paper checks
enables the banks to keep closer tabs on their customers.  When people move,
one of the first things they do is order new checks.  But all this may be
changing -- a new standard called IFX is due out in February, which will
enable consumers to receive bills online from any vendor, and analysts say
people are much more likely to pay an electronic invoice electronically
(and, conversely, a paper bill with a paper check).  "When checkless
transactions do catch on, the adoption rate will be tremendous," predicts a
Deutsche Bank analyst.  (Investor's Business Daily 22 Sep 98)

NET SURFING VS. CHANNEL SURFING
As people become active surfer on the Internet, do they watch less
television?  A study commissioned by Discovery Networks has concluded that,
as households begin to use the Internet, television use by teenagers tends
to drop but use by everyone else tends to increase.  (New York Times 21 Sep 98)

FREE INTERNET SERVICE IN THE U.K.
British consumer electronics retailer Dixons Group and telecommunications
firm Energis are teaming up to provide a free Internet service to citizens
in the U.K.  Users will not be required to pay any registration or usage
fees, but will be charged $1.68 a minute for technical support.  The move is
expected to force other Internet service providers in that country to
reevaluate their pricing structures.  (Wall Street Journal 23 Sep 98)

>From Edupage:


WEB PATENTS WEAVE CONFUSION
A federal appellate court ruling in July confirming that computerized
"business methods" can be patented has sparked a wave of patent applications
that electronic commerce proponents fear will amount to "holdups in
cyberspace."  The July case involved a computerized mathematical formula for
apportioning the administrative costs associated with a family of mutual
funds, but by "claiming the computer as part of the invention, you can make
things patentable that weren't patentable before," says a patent attorney in
California.  Skeptics say many of the new patents won't hold up in court,
and will suffer the same fate as the 1993 patent granted to Compton New
Media, protecting a method for combining text, audio and video on a compact
disk.  That patent was revoked in 1994, after critics demonstrated the
technology was already in common use.  "Everyone is under the impression the
Patent Office thoroughly investigates your claims," says a Forrester
Research analyst.  "They really don't."  (Wall Street Journal 9 Oct 98)
[Compton's also tried to TradeMark the term Multimedia. . .a term I had
used in print as early as the late '70's. . .I still have copies. . .]

PCs BREAK $500 PRICE BARRIER
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that newly formed Emachines is
introducing a fully equipped PC, including a monitor, for less than $500.
The $499 eTower sports a 266 MHz Cyrix microprocessor, a 2.1 gigabyte hard
drive, 32 megabytes of memory, a 56K modem, a CD-ROM drive and a 14-inch
monitor.  The same machine can be purchased without the monitor for $399.
"Five hundred dollars is the magic number for opening up the next wave of
adopters in the home," says the company's CEO.  Emachines is a joint venture
of two Korean companies -- TriGem and Korean Data Systems.  The company is
planning to offer several other computers in the next year or so, including
a 300 MHz eTower with monitor for $599, an ultralight notebook for under
$2,000 and an entertainment device for playing games and watching DVD
movies.  (St. Petersburg Times 10 Oct 98)

SHOULD THE NET BE PRIVATIZED?
The organization called Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility has
begun a battle against a Clinton Administration plan that would largely turn
over management of Internet domain names to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit
corporation.  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, a member of the group,
says the plan is flawed because it gives too much power to a commercially
minded corporation with a potentially self-perpetuating board.  Saying that
such an entity is unlikely to be a strong enough watchdog for privacy, free
speech, due process and other democratic values, Lessig asks:  "If
government doesn't protect those values, who will?"  (AP 10 Oct 98)

COMPUTERS INSTEAD OF CASH ON CAL. STATE CAMPUS
California State University at San Marcos is offering needy students
computers rather than tuition money as part of a new scholarship program.
The students receive a laptop, a set of software and technical training.  If
they graduate, they get to keep the computer.  "We're a very high-tech
university with a lot of low-income students," says the school's
financial-aid director.  "We have been wrestling with a problem of the
'have/have-not.'"  The university requires all students to demonstrate
computer literacy during their first year.  (Chronicle of Higher Education 9
Oct 98)

Subject: Project Gutenberg Newsletter [Lots! More Free Books]
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Thu, 5 Nov 1998 07:41:55 -0600 (CST)


****This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December 10, 1998****
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

If you ever take the time to read this Newsletter beginning to the end
. . .this is probably the best time. . .there is a LOT of information,
for both those who just want to get our books, and, also for those who
want to help create those books.


This Newsletter is actually being posted November's first Wednesday in
response to the new United States copyright laws passed just last week
and is thus doing double duty; as the December 10th Newsletter is more
traditionally a venue for releasing some Etexts of the best classics--
which I most often dedicate to my father, who passed away December 10,
9 years ago, just after getting Project Gutenberg's initial supporter,
with one of his brilliant ideas that kept amazing me all of my life!!!

So. . .here is the biggest Project Gutenberg Newsletter of all time...
containing more Etexts than ever before, and, getting us more ahead of
schedule than ever before...with more people to contact about becoming
a Project Gutenberg volunteer than ever before, and even more. . . .

This has been a VERY hectic week, as I came back out of vacation mode,
just a week ago today, having posted only about 5 Etexts in 12 days of
vacation since our previous Newsletter, and in that one week we posted
all 31 Etexts left to complete the next month, as well as the 49 files
of our new, and more complete, AND PUBLIC DOMAIN, Shakespeare edition!
[During the writing of this Newsletter we have posted three more Etext
files for May, 1999, appended at the end of the lists.  We also should
be posting the newly revised copyrighted Shakespeare files any minute.
Sue and Greg may be sending you an independent Newsletter about those.

So. . .please forgive me if I have overdone or underdone anything here
. . .I am already 7 hours late in getting this posted as we speak.

Michael S. Hart
Project Gutenberg
Executive Director

***

0.  Late news items.

I [Michael Hart] will be hard to reach for the coming month, as I
will be meeting with a number of people, doing conferences, house
hunting in Tacoma, and all that stuff, and, hopefully taking rest
and refuge from everything to prepare to continue the fight for a
reversal of the new copyright laws in court.

So, in addition to emailing me at hart@pobox.com, you should also
cc:

Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>,
  or Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu> if you can't get to Sue

Sue and Greg will be posting the books while I am gone, and maybe
even sending out one of these Newsletters!

Please also be encouraged to contact:


Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>,  United States
David Price <ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk>  England
John Bickers <jbickers@ihug.co.nz>  New Zealand

[But don't feel you can only contact the one who
is closest to you. . . .]

[We don't want Sue and Greg to be too inundated with everything.]
They are not nearly as used to this as are Dianne, David and John,
and I hope you will be as considerate of them all as possible.

Thanks!

Michael

***

For those who access our sites to get or send Etexts:

archive.org has been through a MAJOR crash as is not,
at least at this moment, fully recovered, so you may
want to try our other sites.  Email Sue and Newby to
find out where to send files if you have trouble.  I
note that sunsite.unc.edu is not accepting files for
the moment because the disk is full. . .more on this
in the Volunteers' Newsletter in a day or so.  Newby
just this minute let me know that archive.org is up,
at least for "outgoing" to send us files, but now it
requires a "cd work" command after FTPing in.  Newby
will try to get the /etext directories running ASAP,
so you can get the normal files from archive.org

[Right. . ."ootgoing" is now "outgoing" [cd work]!!!


1.

As usual, before we even get started, here are requests to
find certain books our volunteers would LOVE to work on:


The works of Francesca Franco [of "Dangerous Beauty" fame]
<cyri@juno.com> Tania


William Blake, The Four Zoas
We have someone who is willing to pay for part of the cost
of getting a copy of this. . .and will proofread.  You can
contact me directly about this one. . . .  If the price is
decent, just go ahead and get it if the copyright is 1922,
or earlier. . .but please don't ship it to me yet. . . .


Burton's Arabian Nights. . .for:
Ron Burkey <rburkey@heads-up.com>
Unabridged, dated before 1923 in
copyright or publication info.

and

Would anyone be interested in collecting up pieces of the Human
Genome to post on Project Gutenberg?  It is often requested.


Here is a list of our Directors of Production, please feel free
to contact them during the next month as I will be hard to get.

2.  While "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat" is away, will mice play?

I will be hard to reach for the next month, hobnobbing with my fellow
wizards as I tend to do every year at this time.  I hope to come back
with some major support for Project Gutenberg, as I am aging quickly,
and surprised myself quite a bit with our huge rush of production for
the past three months.  It appears we have posted over 267 new files,
with some 216 of them as new editions, all in the past 92 days or so.
In fact, the 36 April Etexts, and all the new and revised Shakespeare
files were posted in the last two weeks. . .someday I hope we can get
that much work done EVERY two weeks!



3.  A first glance at the new copyright laws.

I was only a week ago that the new copyright laws were signed, and it
is my honor to tell you that our volunteers and supporters have great
will power when it comes to a call to arms.  The HUGE book production
over the past two weeks was actually nearly all posted in just 1 week
since this new law took effect.  [I had already gone into what I call
"vacation mode" after sending out the mid-month Newsletter, and, only
4 or 5 new books had been posted between the Newsletter and the law--
when I announce an effort to avenge the passing of the law by posting
as many books as possible for the next Newsletter, which would now be
set for only one week away, instead of six weeks away.

No way I can say NEARLY enough about our volunteers and directors, as
they really and truly CAME THROUGH IN A TIME OF CRISIS to let a world
know that we were not going to knuckle under to the pressure!

A tip of the hat to all of them!!

Now, on the legal matters.

At first glance, the major effect on the Public Domain is destruction
. . .plain and simple. . .for the next 20 years. . .and more, if they
pass another such law, which, I am sure they will try their damnedest
to do. . .THERE WILL BE NO MORE PUBLIC DOMAIN BOOKS IN THE U.S. other
than the ones that had already entered the Public Domain on 1/1/1998.

Even if such a law is NOT passed again and again, the Public Domain a
person might have gotten used to living in this century will only "be
a distant memory before Orwell's Age of 1984" in that a Public Domain
that used to include approximately HALF or 50% of all materials of an
eternity of publishing up to 100 years ago, should now include nearly
0% of the all the materials that will have been published in history,
up to 100 years from now.

Let me put this succinctly:

100 years ago the U.S. Public Domain included about 50% of everything

100 years from now the U.S. Public Domain will include about 0%. .

Here's the simple math:

If copyrighted information doubles every 14 years, and the copyright
usually expires in 14 years, then information is flowing into public
domain access at the same rate it is flowing into copyright. . .so a
quick look tells us that during the time it took to create a world's
new supply of information, the old supply of information came out of
copyright and into the Public Domain. . . .

100 years ago [and up to 1909] the average copyright lasted about 15
years, with most books having 14 years of copyright monopoly and the
copyrights were not renewed, because the books weren't selling after
about 5 years, on the average, for the books that were good enough a
library would have purchased them.  This is still true today. . .you
steal or lose a book over 5 years from a library and the odds are it
cannot be replaced because it has gone out of print.

Since information was doubling just about every 14 years back then--
the result was that half of all information was in the Public Domain
. . .which isn't such a terrible way to have it be. . .the powerful,
the rich, etc., can still have twice as much as those who mostly use
free information.

In my interview last week with the New York Times, the interviewer's
suggestion was that we consider current information to be doubling a
bit faster. . .every 7 years.

If the average copyright were still just over 14 years today, we see
that 75% or 3/4 of all information would still be copyrighted.

The faster information flows through our society, the more is hidden
from the Public Domain by copyrights of the same length.

Under the new copyright law, the average copyright will be nearly an
entire century in length, with no renewals required, and copyrighted
notices are no longer required. . .it will be nearly impossible from
the average person's point of view, to tell whether anything is in a
copyrighted or public domain status, and, it will take some research
to find out. . .this alone is enough to stop most public domain use.

However, even AFTER doing all the copyright research, the struggling
"New Age Public Domain Information Providers" will find that none of
the materials they research will be in the Public Domain. . .none in
the sense that the number will be closer to 0% than to 1%. . .closer
by a HUGE margin to 0% than to 1%.

If the New York Times' estimates of 7 years for information doubling
may be considered at all correct, then this is what will happen in a
United States under the new copyright law, even if we considered 100
percent of current information to the entered into the Public Domain
as an incentive to let this law stand:

 0 years. . .100% of today's information is in the Public Domain
 7 years. . . 50% of today's information is in the Public Domain
14 years. . . 25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
21 years. . . 12.5% of today's information is in the Public Domain
28 years. . .  6.25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
35 years. . .  3.125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
42 years. . .  1.5625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
49 years. . .  0.78125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
56 years. . .  0.390625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
63 years. . .  0.1953125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
70 years. . .  0.09765625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
77 years. . .  0.048828125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
84 years. . .  0.0244140625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
91 years. . .  0.01220703125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
98 years. . .  0.006103515625% of today's information is in the Public Domain

This is literally just one book out of some 10,000 books that will be
in the Public Domain after about 95 years of a 95 year copyright even
if information does NOT continue to increase faster and faster. . . .

Many people think information is ALREADY doubling faster than 7 years
for each doubling, but all that does is make the total reach 0.00001%
etc., etc., etc.

And you though Big Brother had a thing for monopolizing information.

This is the beginning of

The Information Wars

Since they can no longer stop us from talking to each other via email
or etext or the Web, or FTP, etc., they are passing laws that tell us
we cannot include 99.99% of all the information in the world, because
it is not all protected by copyright.

One last word about the new copyright law. . . .

I plan to be in court as soon as possible as a test case to defeat it
once and for all. . .wish me luck!


4.  The 36 Project Gutenberg Etexts for April, 1999.

We have chosen, with great effort and glee, to present what many call
the greatest epic of all time as our lead story this month. . .in two
separate translations. . .The Odyssey, by Homer.

We are also including more Plato and Socrates, O Henry, H. Rider Haggard, and
B. M. Bower, as well as several more G. K Chestertons, Balzacs, Conrads, etc.
including some of Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte.  We also included a bit
more Mary Roberts Rinehart and Jules Verne.

We hope you enjoy reading these as much as we enjoy bringing them to you.

5.  The 49 NEW Project Gutenberg Complete Works of Shakespeare,
    this one is in the Public Domain, at least in the U.S.

Remember:  these are in /etext98, we reserved the slots for them
before we got on the HUGE production run that doubled the Etexts
coming out over the past three months. . .during this period our
volunteers have created about 266 Etext files for you to read.

The revised versions of our OLD Shakespeare are done and will be
announced. . .I just don't have the filenames for them. . .since
we didn't release them as separate files back in 1994, we cannot
just put them in /etext94 as updates to old filenames.  This may
mean they will have to appear as June and July, 1999 Etexts; the
April Etexts are all done, and we may have already started May.

6.   The NEWLY REVISED editions of our 100th Etext, the copyrighted
    version of Shakespeare's works. . .1,000s of errors corrected!

These will likely be in /etext99, stay tuned for Newsletters from
Sue and Greg about these.

The filenames will be same as above only instead of starting with
a 2 or 3, they will start with 1, and the revision number is 11:

so 2ws0110.txt and .zip are the NEW Public Domain edition of Henry
as listed above in /etect98
and 1ws0111.txt and .zip will be the revised [11] old copyrighted edition
in /etext94 and the new files will be in /etext99

If you have any problems finding these on your own, you can ask
Sue Asscher, listed above, how to find them.  If you are using
an index, don't forget that it takes our indexers quite a while
to get this many etext indexed, so you might want learn how to
use FTP, or the FTP functions in your browers, to get them now.

Remember:  if you get these files directly, without a "point and click"
you will need to go to three different directories:

April will be in /etext99
The NEW Shakespeare will be in /etext98
The revised versions from Etext #100 will be in /etext99
The original version of Etext #100 is still in /etext94
Etext #100 was originally released on December 10, 1993,
for an official release date of January, 1994.
Hard to believe we have posted 1628 Etexts since then,
an average of nearly one Etext per day.  [Literally ~.9]



7.  Who is "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat," anyway?  Or what?

I am pictured as the 2nd in the list of the Wired 25 for 1998 and
since I don't like having my picture taken, I tend to clown a bit
for the camera to make it more exciting. . .so I am sitting in my
chair in the middle of a country road through the cornfields with
a "long-stemmed American Beauty" between my teeth. . .well you'll
understand when/if you see the picture. . .and I'm wearing my own
trademark red t-shirt with a "Cat in the Hat" hat. . . .

OK, let's make it brief, I often either break into a sweat or may
seem too self-important when these things come up. . . .

First. . .please let me remind you that I probably do less than 1
percent of the work it takes to do Project Gutenberg; maybe less,
when I consider how many Project Gutenberg sites there are that I
don't even know about, and probably never will.

I accept any awards to Project Gutenberg, or myself, on behalf of
all of our volunteers, past, present and future and I forward all
the "Thank You Notes" I get, whether via email or snailmail on to
the entire list of volunteers on our listserver.

I tried to get WIRED to give this award to Project Gutenberg as a
whole:  and you probably don't want to hear the whole story about
that. . . .

To make a long story short Wired finally seems to have bought the
tickets to send me to the award banquet to receive "The WIRED 25"
award, for which they commisioned a world famous architect, and I
also get a pair of tennis shoes, a hotel room, and a limo, to and
from LAX. . .I promise to enjoy it all as much as possible in the
honor of all our volunteers.

"THOSE WHO DARE
  THE WIRED 25
  A SALUTE TO:
   DREAMERS,
  INVENTORS,
  MAVERICKS,
   LEADERS"

"Life is short.

"Especially when you're determined to break all the rules."

If you want to read the rest, I suppose I should encourage
you to go out and buy the November issue of Wired. . .it says
THE WIRED 25 right in the middle of the cover, can't miss it.
The first half of my name is obscured by the 25. . . .

IT'S OFFICIAL:  NEW NAME FOR NT 5.0.
The next-gen OS becomes "Windows 2000."
They are trying to get it out before 2000.

MICROSOFT SAYS IT WAS NETSCAPE THAT SUGGESTED A DEAL
In the antitrust suit against Microsoft, Microsoft has introduced a December
1994 e-mail message from Netscape chairman James Clark as evidence that it
was Netscape rather than Microsoft that first suggested an arrangement to
illegally restrain trade.  Clark had written to a Microsoft executive:  "We
have never planned to compete with you.  We want to make this company a
success, but not at Microsoft's expense.  We'd like to work with you.
Working together could be in your self-interest as well as ours.  Depending
on the interest level, you might take an equity position in Netscape, with
the ability to expand the position later."  He added:  "No one in my
organization knows about this message."  A Microsoft attorney yesterday
asked Netscape president James Barksdale of Netscape chairman and cofounder
James Clark:  "Do you regard him as a truthful man?"  Barksdale paused and
then replied:  "I regard him as a salesman."  The Microsoft attorney said:
"I'm not going to touch that." (New York Times 22 Oct 98)


ANOTHER TRY AT FREE NET SERVICE
NetZero Inc. is offering free Internet service to consumers, operating on an
advertising-based business model.  The company isn't selling your typical
banner ad, however.  NetZero's banners can "follow" users from site to site
as they peruse the Web.  The company says it's spent a year developing
software that tracks users' habits, enabling advertisers to pinpoint their
messages more efficiently.  "We can target within a 12-mile radius of where
(a subscriber) lives," says NetZero's CEO.  Idealab Capital Partners, which
is backing the venture, thinks subscribers will like the free access despite
the ads.  "People are spending $21.95 a month for AOL -- that's a lot of
money," says Idealab's managing director.  "We offer a value proposition
that's hard to beat."  (Investor's Business Daily 19 Oct 98)

"GRASSROOTS" LOBBY EFFORT ROOTED AT AT&T
The Prince George's Coalition Against Hidden Taxes, supposedly a grassroots
lobbying effort organized in Maryland, has been revealed to be a massive
effort by AT&T to defeat proposed legislation that would charge a fee of 3%
of gross revenues generated by telecom companies seeking to use public
rights of way to lay cable, string wire, or plant cellular towers to provide
new services.  AT&T considers the legislation unfair because it singles out
telecommunications companies from other users of public land, such as
sanitary commissions and gas & electric companies.  Calling the Coalition's
media campaign a "massive fraud," the Prince George's County chief executive
said, "This isn't any citizens coalition.  This is a bunch of giant
companies trying to profit off the public for free."  (Washington Post 24
Oct 98)

E-BOOKS TO COME SINGING DOWN THE WIRE
Saying that "if you can get to the Web, you can buy a book -- instantly,"
the chief executive of NuvoMedia unveiled his company's paperback-size,
22-ounce $499 electronic Rocket eBook at Barnes & Noble, the bookstore and
publishing company that will make titles available for downloading onto a
personal computer.  Books will sell for $18 to $25, and downloading of a
book will take 2 to 5 minutes.  Tapping a button will allow the reader to
scroll through the book, which will include a built-in dictionary and allow
electronic underlining, note-taking, word search, and font changes.
Generally similar products are being developed by other manufacturers,
including SoftBook Press and Everybook Inc.  (AP 23 Oct 98)

on vacation. . .a vacation I am certainly glad to be back from.  It is
odd to say, but everything when pretty much the opposite as expected--
I had a great time in LA accepting the WIRED 25 "Oscar" on behalf of a
thousand Project Gutenberg volunteers, and did all I was asked to do &
and bit more at the party. . .[I was indeed the "life of the party."]

As I often try to do, we have managed some new Shakespeare to honor my
father, who died 9 years ago today, and for whom I try to do some work
on this day each year, as well as to light a candle for him.  I have a
GREAT BIG THANK YOU to our Shakespeare Team for getting this ready for
today, you will see THOUSANDS of corrections in these new files!!!  My
father was a great Shakespeare professor, who instilled in me and many
others a great feeling for the classics, in literature, music and art.

This one's for you, Dad!

***

A note from our US Director of Production, Dianne Bean:

Working on a reasonable-sized-print book, water damaged at the bottom:
Testing Omnipage 9 on it and there's a HUGE difference between this and
Textbridge--they improved the OCR so it's better by a mile than
Textbridge, no longer even close...I'm only picking up 1 or 2 errors on a
page; where the pages are a little warped at the bottom, TB was making an
awful garble, but OP sails right through! And it hasn't crashed yet.

***

I will be meeting with Lawrence Lessig of Harvard, who apparently is the
one the Supreme Court of the US chose to teach them about computers, and
about the Internet.  We will be planning the lawsuit to challenge all of
the new copyright extensions we tried so hard to keep from becoming law.
He has asked for some serious volunteers who would also like to sue; the
cases are more secure when there are several plaintiffs, not just one.

Just email me if you are interested.  I meet with him Monday.  We should
also like to receive any points you would like included in the suit, and
we would like these whether or not you are willing to be a plaintiff.

Most of these Shakespeare files are vastly improved versions from our
original Complete works of Shakespeare [Etext #100] but some are new.
We had so many requests to post Shakespeare as individual files, that
we decided a whole new version was worth the effort, and here it is!!

Note:  We don't have new versions for all the works yet. . .but will.

ORACLE, SUN TEAM UP TO RIVAL MICROSOFT
Oracle and Sun Microsystems are joining forces to develop new software that
would "take low-cost, easy-to-use Internet computing to a new level" while
at the same time competing head-on with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.  Internet computing, a term coined by Oracle, focuses on using
browser software as the interface to all other applications.  Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison also recently revealed plans to market a new version of the
company's popular database software that requires no operating system.
(Financial Times 14 Dec 98)


IBM'S PRESENT TO THE INTERNET
IBM is contributing to the momentum of the "open source software" movement
by freely distributing original ("source") code to a new e-mail program
called Secure Mailer which, like products such as "Sendmail," "Q Mail," and
"Microsoft Exchange," stores and forwards e-mail messages with a high degree
of security.  Computer security expert Abner Germanow of a prominent market
research firm says, "This is IBM's Christmas present to the Internet.  For
these are core pieces of software, and we're going beyond trying to make
money off of them, to the idea that by freely sharing them it will make the
world a better place."  (New York Times 14 Dec 98)

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter of Wednesday, January 6, 1999
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


As you may recall from past years, we usually do not send this out the
first Wednesday of the year, so it won't get lost in your mailbox when
you return from the holidays, but this year is just going to be so hot
with potential that I thought we should get a head start.

More about all of the 1999 project and deadlines shortly.

Right now we just need to get more xeroxes in from pre-1923 editions,
so we can get your copyright research done.


We have more interest than ever in getting all languages on line; this
will take an ENORMOUS effort, and we will need some very energetic and
patient volunteers to coordinate these efforts.  We would like to find
at least two or three volunteers willing to be Team Leader for various
language teams we will be forming. . .this is going to take some work!

We will be notifying all those who volunteered to work on Spanish. . !


Here are some examples of other interests:

From:  Leonidas Hatzinikolaou <leonidas@hatzinikolaou.org>
I write to you, Michael, with the following proposal: I'm volunteering
to undertake the task of coordinating a collective effort in my country
to digitally publish Greek books in the public domain, both in the Greek
language and translations of them (wherever they can be found) in
English, under the auspices of the GUTENBERG PROJECT. The formats and
all rules of submissions of the e-texts will be according to the rules
established by the GUTENBERG PROJECT. I will try to spread the message
all over Greece asking for more volunteers to help in our task. I will
check-out the texts, their copyright status, etc. Currently I have a web
site under development (http://www.hatzinikolaou.org), where I can host
the Greek e-texts (which require Greek fonts, etc.), which, of course, I
will forward as soon as I receive them to the GUTENBERG PROJECT.

and. . .

Can we work on a few pieces of art, or more music?

Is it possible to, for example, generate a nice
image of the Mona Lisa?  Or a few more MIDI files
of the great classics?  Maybe some of DaVinci's neat
graphics.

It's not text, but would be nice to spice things
up.  What I don't know about are the copyright problems
for art and how to get a high-rez image....I could
visit France and take my own photos...

For suggested books (I'm not volunteering, but in
case you want ideas to pass on);
        Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell. (1910)
also    Newton's Principia (don't know how old an English translation we can
find...

****

And. . .a piece of good news for you who buying new computers:

Current PC sales at the end of 1998:

$1,000 is the current average price--
$800 - $1200 accounts for 67% of all:
1 computer out of 6 costs over $1200:
1 computer out of 6 costs under $800.

***

And now here are the usual 36 Etexts we provide in each Newsletter. . . .

28 are officially for release in August, 1999, and 8 or 9 more in
June, 1999. . .you MAY want to replace the listing we sent to you
for June two months ago, as it will be easier than pasting in.

LIBRARY REMOVES SOFTWARE FILTERS
Responding to a federal court's ruling that the Loudoun County (VA.)
library's use of software filters to screen out sexually explicit material
on the Internet was unconstitutional (Edupage 24 Nov 98), the Library Board
has removed filters from some of its computers and left them on others;
adults will decide whether they want to use a computer with a filter or one
without, and parents of minors will be asked to sign a statement specifying
whether or not they want their child to have unfiltered Internet access.
Library patron Becky Montcastle-Jones urged the library board to appeal the
court's ruling, saying:  "We have not had pornographic or salacious material
in our library.  Why, just because we have new technology to get to it very
quickly, should we have any different policy?  In the video section, you
can't go in there and get a pornographic movie.  Librarians throughout
history have had to make choices about what will be in the library.  That's
not censorship -- that's choice."  But board member Marc Leepson expressed
the view of 6 out of the 8 board members:  "I'm completely comfortable with
the new policy.  It's constitutional, and it still protects children."
(Washington Post 3 Dec 98)

NBC ACQUIRES PART OF "WOMEN'S CONTENT" SITE
Noting that women "happen to be the fastest-growing element on the
Internet," an executive of the NBC television network has announced it will
promote the iVillage Internet service, which he described as "the leading
women's content site."  NBC, in turn, will receive an ownership stake in
that service, which now also provides information about parenting, families
and health for special sites on Snap -- an ad-supported Web site owned by
NBC and C/NET.  (USA Today 30 Nov 98)

NADER GROUP CHALLENGES AOL-NETSCAPE MERGER
Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Project, a group run by long-time consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, says it will vigorously oppose the merger between
America Online and Netscape.  "We feel this will harm competition in the ISP
market," says director James Love.  "ISPs will have to go to Netscape or
Microsoft for browser software.  They compete against both and if they have
to go to them to get software, it creates all kinds of problems."  Love says
his group plans to ask the Justice Department or the Federal Trade
Commission to nix the merger.  "We don't care if Netscape sells its company
to anybody else but AOL or Microsoft."  (TechWeb 25 Nov 98)

DOD FALSIFIED Y2K DATA BUT HAS "GOOD FEELING" ABOUT FUTURE
A Department of Defense inspector-general report says that the Defense
Special Weapons Agency never conducted required tests on three of five
"mission critical" computer systems it had certified as Y2K-compliant.  The
military officer assigned to correct the agency's Year 2000 problems says he
agrees with the report but that the systems in question will be "100% in
compliance" by April 1999:  "I have a good feeling about Y2K in this
agency."  (USA Today 27-29 Nov 98)

Subject: Gutenberg Volnteers' Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Project Gutenberg Volunteers' List" <gutvol-l@listserv.oit.unc.edu>
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 11:29:40 -0600 (CST)


This is Project Gutenberg's Volunteers' Newsletter for February, 1999

We are redoing Pride and Prejudice. . .if anyone is interested in new
work on this, please let me know. . .we could possibly use some help.

We are also going to need some serious help if we are going to get to
Don Quixote in Spanish for our Etext #2000, which is only now some 90
Etexts away. . .and we have not had much luck in finding editions the
copyright has obviously gone out of. . . .  We need to find editions,
from any country, that were published before 1923. . . .

***

I have a bunch of books available for scanning. For
list, please see:

http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/mdo1/scanbook.html

Michael Oltz <mdo1@cornell.edu>

***

Things have gone pretty slowly since the holidays, the last 45 days
might be first time I can remember that we have not actually made a
number of Etexts equal to our schedule, though we are still quite a
bit ahead of our 1999 schedule, but falling back slightly.

If you have sent in xeroxes or Etexts I have not dealt with, please
let me know. . . .

***

Here are the thank you notes that have arrived since the last issue
of the Volunteers' Newsletter.

*

I probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to read this and be thus
affected if it were not on the internet.  Thank you for the work you
are doing. God bless.

While I am writing I shall add that your Gutenberg Project is excellent.
I have downloaded many books, and even managed to find time to read a few,
and passed the books and your site location on to others.

I will pass you kind words on to our volunteers!

By the way, please keep up the GREAT work!  I thoroughly enjoy the
e-texts.  And more importantly, I'm certain my children and future
generations will reap incalculable rewards from your diligence.

Bravo for this fantastic Project, like "Amanuenses" six centuries after.

THANK YOU for PG invention & inventory.

I was thrilled to find the volumes of material that
have populated the web as a result of your project.

Thanks for your work.  It is much appreciated.

I've long enjoyed using your e-texts from way back.

Project Gutenburg speaks well of yourself and your endeavors.

Regards and congratulations on what you have achieved.

As a literature student, I find you websites
interesting and very helpful.

I have been aware of your wonderful e-text library
and benefitted from it on several occasions.

We all congratulate you for your work on Project Gutenberg.

I have used the Project Guttenberg site to read some
great classics, and I also want to say thanks for that.

Thanks not only for a great work, but also for a great idea...

Congratulations for your project.

What a wonderful and generious gift to share with the world!
I am so impressed with what you are doing in creating an
electronic public library for the world.  Thank you very
much for being so insightful and wanting to share knowledge
with so vast an  audience.  In a way this is probably the
first distance learning site on the internet.

With all your hard work you rightfully deserve much respect.
Thanks and please keep up your good work.

brbhan@juno.com,
brbhan@empireone.net

Your project is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ever imagined since
the printing press, indeed! And you can be sure that over here, in France,
your internet address is transmitted to whoever might be interested.

Thanks for your GREAT site!

I read the Wired article about PG and your work and you have truly
inspired me to look at the world in a completely new way. The work
you are doing will probably revolutionise the world.  Keep up the
excellent work!

I am very glad that you have created such an incredible project.
Your online resources and your promotion of literacy is invaluable.

In the meantime... I offer my congratulations and
encouragement for your wonderful enterprise.

Thanks very much for Project Gutenberg, a terrific effort
in IMHO one of the nicer things the internet can offer.

First allow me to express my appreciation for the excellent
work which you and your various teams are performing.

Finally!  The site I have been waiting for!   Wonderful!

I read the Wired profile of your great Gutenberg work, and I want to
congratulate you and offer my encouragement and appreciation.

I wanted to say that I've enjoyed a number of the texts that you've
posted at Project Gutenberg, and I look forward to seeing more.

I recently learned about Project Gutenberg and wrote to you on October 29
for information on downloading.  You replied on October 30.  I have now
downloaded three titles and plan to increase my library.  I think your site
is incredible.  I've been telling everyone I know about it.

Recently, I came across promo.net. I think what the Gutenberg project is
doing is nothing less than spectacular. Preserving the world's literature,
I'm sure, is quite the accomplishment. Good job and thank you.

I would also like to thank you for the work you are coordinating here.
I feel that this is a very worthy project and believe deeply in the
freedom of information; as well as giving greater access to great works
and valuable literature.

Keep up the good work!!

Thank you for making these texts available to me...I have been looking for the
book "The Mansion" by Henry Van Dyke...and someone e=mailed me that I could
find it here and so much more.  You have done a wonderful service.
I can't wait to have time to look through all those wonderful books.

I am sure that you get a lot of response from the users of your web site.
I only want to recap what I am sure the majority of your respondents
communicate. I love your concept and the materials that you provide
to the world.

After seeing all these copyright statements on these HTML books, I
have a greater appreciation for what Project Gutenberg is trying to
accomplish. I wonder what part of "Public Domain" they don't understand.

I recently visited Project Putenberg, and I was really interested.
I am very fond of reading books, especially the classics.

Congratulations, it is a great public service web page.

For many years I have admired the efforts of all the volunteers of Project
Gutenberg, to offer to anyone with an interest in reading, FREE books in
digital format. Actually, you offer more than free books --you offer
accessibility to otherwise hard-to-be-found material.

Keep up the good work there.  I admire your ambitious undertaking.

I should tell you: in the last two days I've been approached by several
people who have already read selections from your collection and are
delighted to have access.  Yours is a good mission! [From a new site]

Thanks a million and keep up the good work!!!
I spent some very enjoyable hours reading from your website.

I am  writing you as a result of my recent delighted
exposure to the Project Gutenberg sites on the internet.

Came across Project Gutenberg. I must say, you have a
great looking website and an excellent thing going on here!

I want to say that I recently was introduced to your project and the
related web sites by a friend who works in the head trauma/special needs
environment.  I was impressed by the collection you have amassed and to
my surprise I was given privilege to hear the text spoken with some
software that translated the etext.  It truly was a revelation for me.

I just read about your Project in Biblio's recent article about etexts
and am captivated by what you have done.  Have subscribed to your newsletter.
Just want to thank you for this phenomenal resource I am only just beginning
to mine.  [Mine is a Web term for getting value from the Internet]

Congratulations for the very interesting
and important work that you are all doing.

Thanks for your continued efforts!

I am very grateful for the e-texts that Project Gutenberg has made available.
Thank you for making information and literature available on the Internet.

I read about your work with project gutenburg in wired.
I've always been a great fan of getting literature and books on the web.
I think your efforts are magnificent and should be continued.
Thanks for all your hard work, hopefully someday people will
understand the importance of this.

I hope you will add my own thanks to the list

This is a resend of yesterday's Newsletter. . .due to rebooting, a few
things went wrong with the header and most copies did not go out.  The
error is now corrected in our mainframe, and we are including one book
we did not include yesterday, a good one, to make it more worthwhile a

This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for, Wednesday, March 3, 1999
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


We need lots of help this month. . .please see below, if willing. . .!

Below that. . .we also have another month's worth of Etexts for you!!!

Contents:

0.  Just found out today, we are going to NEED some moderate funds,
    now, not just what I had hoped for the future! . . .more later.
1.  We Need Serious Help With Other Languages, More Than I Can Say.
2.  Project Gutenberg Etexts Now Available Via FTPMail. . . .
3.  Requests for Rafael Sabatini
The Sea-Hawk,  Captain Blood, or Banner of the Bull, pre-1923 books.
4  New This Month. . .besides the month's Etexts, more Shakespeare of
the apocryphal nature, a new edition Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.


It looks like we are going to need some VERY serious people to help on
doing Etexts in other languages. . .I am not willing to give up on the
other languages. . .but I now realize just how important it is to have
someone who can help coordinate the efforts in other languages. . . .


A.  Don Quixote in Spanish

We are apparently going to need ALL THE HELP WE CAN POSSIBLY GET if we
are going to present this as our 2,000th Etext--if you know anyone who
can help find pre-1923 editions, or who is willing to help proofread--
I don't want to put this off. . .it is too good a choice. . .HELP!!!

***

Don Quixote in Spanish. . .we are not getting very far with this one--
we have only about two more months before we COULD post Etext #2000...
BUT...I am willing to put this off until 1/1/2000 if that's what it is
going to take to get something rolling.  I think it is very important,
more than I can say, to do more Etexts in more languages. . . .



B.  La Tulipe Noire in French

La Tulipe Noire, in French, by Alexandre Dumas. . .we have an Etext in
. . .but it needs some serious proofreading. . .we would LOVE to do an
entire series of Dumas in French and English, and others in French!

It is now possible to get any Gutenberg File via Email.  You simply send a
message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with your request in the
subject and the file is sent back as a MIME attachment.  Please note,
however, that your request must follow a specific syntax in order to be
fulfilled properly.  For a complete set of instructions send a message to
gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with the word and only the word "help" in
the subject.  That's help not Help or HELP.  Also, do not include the
quotes.  If you have any questions, feel free to Email
Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

Lets say that you want the book Marten Hyde.  Well that book is called
mhyde10.txt and it is in the etext98 directory.  To get via email, simply
send a message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with a subject line of
"get etext98 mhyde10.txt" without the quotes.  So your message would look
something like this:

From: you@yoursite.com
To: gutenberg@fireantproductions.com
Subject: get etext98 mhyde10.txt

The message body is ignored.

***


New this month:


Addition to our recent new releases of Shakespeare:
Jun 1999 Sir John Oldcastle, Shakespeare [Apocryphal]      [1ws5110x.xxx]1788

We have also fixed 1ws2610.* which were accidentally
saved as WordPerfect files rather than in PVASCII.
Those are in /etext97

We have also corrected thousands of errors in Etexts
over the past month or two while things were slowed
down over the holidays.  Of course, with approximately
2,000 Etexts, this represents only an average of a few
errors corrected in each one, but you will find more
corrections in those with filenames with higher numbers.
i.e. xxxxx11.txt will have major corrections from *10.txt
and xxxxxx12.txt will have major corrections from *11.txt,
and so on.  We hope you will continue to send us email of
any errors or suggestions.  We do not ALWAYS change the
version number when we make only a few correction, but
it might be worthwhile to download new copies once a year
or so, or to check the dates on the prairienet.org site
against the dates on your files. . .I don't think the
other sites keep our dates, sorry. . .except that the
.zip files should unzip to the real file dates.

AND VIEWERS FIGHT BACK AGAINST WEB AD OVERLOAD
Meanwhile, Web surfers weary of enduring the "pulsating, candy-colored wave
of advertising that has spread across the Internet," increasingly are
turning to ad-blocking software to speed up their download times.  "They are
a symbol of people saying, 'I'm not going to take it anymore,'" says Jakob
Nielsen, co-founder of the Nielsen-Norman Group.  The ad blockers, which
automatically eliminate all advertising from Web pages, go by names like
WebWasher, InterMute and AtGuard.  Many online advertisers dismiss the trend
toward ad-blocking, noting that when faster connections are available,
consumers will not be so annoyed about being forced to download cumbersome
advertisement files.  "Consumers understand the basic proposition that all
the free things are enabled by advertising," says the chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau.  "Advertising is transforming the business
model."  (Los Angeles Times 2 Mar 99)

OPEN UNIVERSITY OFFERS FIRST ONLINE COURSE
Britain's Open University, one of the oldest distance education institutions
in existence, this week launched its first online course -- "You, Your
Computer and the Net."  The course, which is designed for students with
little or no technical knowledge, has attracted 2,000 students, with one
senior O.U. lecturer calling the response "overwhelming."  Participants will
use a dedicated Web site and will have e-mail access to individual tutors.
The O.U. says the new course is aimed at those "who feel apprehensive about
the apparently inexorable march of the new communications technologies."
(Financial Times 1 Mar 99)

PREPARE FOR Y2K THE WAY YOU'D PREPARE FOR A THREE-DAY BLOW
Senator Chris Dodd's advice for getting ready for Y2K is:  "What you ought
to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane, a storm where you'd like two
or three days of water and canned goods and the like," but you shouldn't
withdraw your money from banks.  A study conducted by Dodd and Senator
Robert Bennett has concluded that there will be no major problems with
regard to the airways, nuclear weapons, or the nation's power grids.  (AP 1

HALF OF U.S. CLASSROOMS ARE NOW WIRED
The Department of Education says that, largely thanks to government
subsidies, 51% of classrooms, school computer and science labs, and school
libraries had Internet connections in the Fall of 1998 (compared to 27% in
1997 and only 3% in 1994).  Smaller and poorer schools are now just as
likely to have Internet connections as larger and wealthier schools.

========
Subject: April Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@pobox.com>
Date: Wed, 7 Apr 1999 11:51:06 -0500 (CDT)


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter, for Wednesday, April 7, 1999
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

This month we have Etexts in English, French and Japanese as well as a
few translations into English from the French, German and Greek.  I am
hopeful we can continue even more in a wide variety of languages.

Several new Project Gutenberg sites listed below and more than a whole
month's worth of new Etexts. . .we finished all of November in March--
so we are 8 months ahead of schedule, instead of our usual 1 month.  I
hope we can finish all the December Etexts in the next 28 days. . . .


Lots of things in this Newsletter, not the least of which is that this
month the Newsletter goes out on the last possible day since the first
Wednesday is April 7th, which will gave us a very long month to get up
to completing the November Etexts, but will leave us with less time to
do the December Etexts, a time that is already overloaded with these:

1.  Every April and October we request new volunteers, before everyone
    leaves for the summer, and when they are firmly back in the fall.

2.  This year we are creating a support system for new our volunteers,
    which will be thoroughly tested this month.  This is a BIG project
    and will take some effort to complete.  If you would be willing to
    help some of our new volunteers get started, please let me know.
    [more below on this, probably the most important thing right now]

3.  We are releasing our first Etext without ASCII characters, and the
    hopes are we will be able to interest many of you in looking at an
    Etext of Rashomon, in Japanese, as well as in translation.  So far
    the translation is not yet complete, but we are working on it.  In
    Japanese, it is the first file in the list below.

4.  We are gearing up for our first official public relations effort--
    if you can help us get some extra media coverage for Etext #2000--
    that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED. . .now is the time to start and
    we will continue right through the official release date of #2000.

5.  We will probably have to get incorporated in the year 2000, so the
    lawyers who can help us with that will also be very appreciated.

6.  The Visually Impaired Team of Project Gutenberg Volunteers:
    Jay Mendham <jmendham@interlog.com>, temporary Team Leader.
    This is a team of visually impaired volunteers who create a
    set of general Etexts for the Project Gutenberg audience.

7.  The next Project Gutenberg message you are likely to receive
    will be a request for volunteers and donations. . .if you do
    not want to read it, feel free to just delete it. . . .  The
    Volunteers' List will receive one more message beforehand.


From:  webmaster@promo.net [Pietro di Miceli]
There is a new PG Volunteers' Board available at:
http://promo.net/pg/vol/wwwboard/
Please use and peruse it and send me any suggestions,
corrections, etc.
Also see:  http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


8.  We are still VERY interested in doing more languages, if you
    can do even ONE Etext, however short, in various languages--
    this would be more appreciated than you can imagine.

Requests:

For May 16, 1999  [Please forward this to Balzac interests. . . .]

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

*

From: Michael Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>

Request for assistance/information: Gothic German typeface

I use a scanner to enter raw manuscript material and a software
package for interpreting into e-text. While the software (Visioneer
ProOCR 100) offers a decent German dictionary for spell checking, it
does not recognize the old German scripts called Fraktur. This
moderately ornate and stylized font has gone out of style since 1945,
but many of the older German originals are available ONLY in this
mode. Examples of this style can be viewed on the Internet at the web
site http://www.waldenfont.com/gutenberg2 and many others (use the
word fraktur with your favorite web search engine).

Do you know of, or can suggest, any means of scanning/parsing this
older typeface? If you have any information, please contact the
Gutenberg Project office or myself (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com).
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated in accelerating several
projects.

*

If you can get a pre-1923 copy of Swiss Family Robinson,
AnneWing@aol.com would either like to borrow it or have
you do some proofing of an Etext she has. . .thanks. mh

*

I have my own personal request. . .someone good with FTP
to help me post books when I am away from my desk.    mh

*

Don Quixote
If anyone is a student at Boston University, their library
system has a 1910-1913 and a 1922-1923 edition which
apparently are circulating, so that would be even better.

*

We need a copy of this because we made an Etext,
then lost contact with the person we sent it to.
Actually we don't really need to HAVE the copy,
if you are willing to do some proofreading.
The Jewel of Seven Stars, by Bram Stoker
Please contact [and cc: hart@pobox.com]:
Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

Notes:

You probably already know about this, but I have found Ebay to be a good
source of books older than 1921. I did a search in the book category for
1921 (in titles and descriptions) and found quite a number of books with
a copyright of 1921 (some even with a scan of the copyright page) So you
might suggest to volunteers looking for a cheap book to contribute to
look at http://www.ebay.com

*

About our Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

Some people thought the filenames would be

pgws05*.txt and .zip

however. . .in this case the volunteer added an extra 0, I know not why,
and the location of the number part changed, so the files you want are:

pgw050xz.txt
pgw050tw.txt
pgw050s.txt
pgw050r.txt
pgw050pq.txt
pgw050mo.txt
pgw050il.txt
pgw050fh.txt
pgw050de.txt
pgw050c.txt
pgw050ab.txt
and
readme.web

Sorry for the confusion, will add to next newsletter. . . .

Newer versions just add one. . .next will be 060. . . .

But most start with versions 10, 11, 12, etc.
Only those we know will be "in progress" for
some time before they are up to our standard,
but are too important not to post immediately
get numbers lower than 10, as an indicator of
"not yet ready for prime time."

>From Edupage:

MICROSOFT RESPONDS TO PRIVACY ISSUE
Reacting to a controversy started when a programmer in Brookline, Mass.,
discovered Windows 98 generates a unique serial number that is implanted in
every electronic document and that can be used to trace the identity of its
author, Microsoft said it will create a software tool to allow customers to
remove the number, which was created to help support specialists diagnose
problems for customers who call with questions.  Jason Catlett, who lobbies
on privacy issues, says, "This is going to be a cleanup job larger than the
Exxon Valdez oil spill.  There are billions of tattooed documents out
there."  (AP 8 Mar 99)

IBM ACTION ENCOURAGES WEB SITES TO POST CLEAR PRIVACY POLICIES
IBM, which is the second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, has decided to
refrain from advertising on any Web sites that do not post clear policies
explaining to visitors of those sites such things as what information about
them is being collected and how it will be used, sold, or otherwise
disseminated for marketing purposes.  IBM is the first large company to
link advertising and privacy policy in this way.  (Wall Street Journal 31

Some, if not most, VCR's won't be able to use the programmed advanced
recording feature.  Do not throw away your VCR in the year 2000.  Set
the year on 1972 because the calendar days of the week and month will
be the same as the year 2000.  Please pass this on because it is very
unlikely the manufacturers will not share this information.  They may
want you to buy a new one that is Y2K compliant.


Next month, Etext #2000. . .I hope!!!


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]

 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You

*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for *Wednesday, May 5, 1999*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Well, we managed to finish the 1999 Etexts 8 months ahead of schedule,
though it has been a struggle to do 36 Etexts each month of 1999 after
doing 72 a month for the last half of 1998.  This is somewhat replying
to those who have asked why don't we make a more difficult schedule in
the year 2000. . .right now there is no way we could be doing more for
each month than we are. . .we are barely getting the 36 Etexts done in
time for the Newsletter each month, which often gives us a few days of
extra time, which we are glad to take advantage of.

We hope you will take the opportunity to volunteer to do your favorite
book[s] from before 1923, and to look over our new volunteers' site at
promo.net, which should make volunteering much more effortless.  Also,
you can email me and the other Project Gutenberg Directors listed. . .

***Announcement***

May 16, 1799

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

***Requests***

We have had many requests for Henrik Ibsen, and done
the copyright research for several editions, but we
have never completed any. . .anyone interested??

***

Apr 1998 Spoon River Anthology, by Edgar Lee Masters [sprvrxxx.xxx]1280

The Web catalogue (WebPAC) allows the user to download
etexts with a mouse click. Using a keyword search, one can
easily find Etexts by including "Gutenberg" as a key word.

We are interested in finding out if there are people at the University of
Texas at Austin and the Harry Ransom Center who are currently involved in the
Gutenberg Project, or thinking of making a contribution to it. Our specific
interest would be in French and Italian texts and public domain English
translations of these texts. To discuss possibilities, please email me at:

>You probably already know about this, but I have found Ebay to be a good
>source of books older than 1921. . . .

Yes indeed, but for most books I think http://www.abebooks.com/ is a better
bet.  It's certainly a lot simpler than all the auction nonsense, tho'
perhaps not as much fun. . . .

****Requests for Assistance from our Volunteers****

*

We need a pre-1923 edition of the Velveteen Rabbit,
or one that SAYS in it that it is a reprint of one.

*

Below is a sample from a German play by Goethe, Iphigenie
auf Taurus.  This material in its entirety will be
available shortly and will need a German-speaking
proofreader.  I am requesting a volunteer to take on the
challenge and assist in the final phase of this project.
Kindly contact me (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com) if you can
offer aid.  Thanks!  Mike Pullen

Arkas.
Verwirrt mu_ ich gestehn, da_ ich nicht wei_,
Wohin ich meinen Argwohn richten soll.
Sind's die Gefangnen, die auf ihre Flucht
Verstohlen sinnen?  Ist's die Priesterin,
Die ihnen hilft?  Es mehrt sich das Ger|cht:
Das Schiff, das diese beiden hergebracht,
Sei irgend noch in einer Bucht versteckt.
Und jenes Mannes Wahnsinn, diese Weihe,
Der heil'ge Vorwand dieser Zvgrung, rufen
Den Argwohn lauter und die Vorsicht auf.

Thoas.
Es komme schnell die Priesterin herbei!
Dann geht, durchsucht das Ufer scharf und schnell

PAPER GOES ELECTRIC
Researchers at Xerox and at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have recently developed electronic ink and electronic
paper, which some analysts say may make traditional paper
obsolete.  Electronic paper is easier on the eyes than a computer
screen because it has a higher contrast, and it can display
millions of different images in the same space.  For example,
analysts say that a paper newspaper could easily fit onto
electronic paper, and information could be changed every morning
by deleting yesterday's news and downloading the current news
with no loss of print quality.  Some former MIT students have
already created a company called E Ink, which has developed
electronic ink and paper products and is testing the prototypes
commercially.  The company recently hung an electronic sign in a
Boston department store, where the display is controlled by a
computer from within the store's main office.  These electronic
posters can have text changed instantaneously.
(New Scientist 05/15/99)


DISPUTES AND UNKNOWNS OF ELECTRONIC RIGHTS ROIL THE BOOK INDUSTRY
For all the hype surrounding electronic books, the fast-moving
industry is having trouble convincing the slow-moving book
industry to get on board.  The Authors' Guild mailed warnings to
its 7,500 members last month criticizing current e-book contracts
as bad deals, saying the distribution fees for e-book
manufacturers are payment schemes that would deny publishers and
authors their rewards in the information age.  Other literary
guilds are also advising authors to stay away from e-book
agreements unless they promise to revise the deals when e-books
become more popular. The book industry says it wants to see the
market grow, but wants the terms to be fair.  Current e-book
deals give authors a share of just 4 percent of the book's list
price, compared to 15 percent for traditional book deals.
(New York Times 05/10/99)

COURT SAYS TEMPS DESERVE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
A federal court of appeals has ruled that about 10,000 temporary workers at
Microsoft are entitled to take part in the discounted stock-option plan the
company offers to regular employees. Industry analyst Rob Enderle says,
"This is a broad decision, and it applies to all businesses.  If you've got
a temp worker putting in 20-plus hours a week, you better start considering
him or her like you would a part-time worker" -- and provide employee
benefits.  The ruling indicated that a temporary worker can be considered a
"common-law employee" if the person's work was controlled not by the
placement agency but by the company for which the work was being done.
Microsoft plans to appeal.  (New York Times 14 May 99)

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WANTS ISPs TO SPY
The European Parliament last Friday passed the Lawful Interception of
Communications council resolution on new technologies -- known as Enfopol --
which requires Internet service providers and telephone companies to provide
law-enforcement agencies with full-time, real-time access to Internet
transmissions, even those traversing along multiple networks.  In addition,
wireless communications providers are required to provide geographical
location information on cell phone users, along with decoding of messages,
if encryption is provided as part of the service.  The European Internet
Service Providers' Association has denounced the resolution.  "Anyone who's
got half a clue about the Internet can easily see the Enfopol proposals are
unfeasible," says the chairman of U.K. ISP Linx. "The problem is it's a
bunch of law-enforcement people who have cooked this up in a vacuum without
public consultation."  He also expressed concerns that the stringent
requirements would prompt Internet users from other countries to route
around Europe, damaging the European telecom industry's revenue.  (TechWeb

PRIVACY PROPOSAL
A Clinton Administration proposal to protect individual financial and
medical records includes a request for more than $5 million to fund an
increase in online surveillance and to train law enforcement officials in
ways to combat security fraud. Congressman Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) explained
the problem to his colleagues by writing:  "Do you believe your banking
transaction experiences are private?  You may be surprised to learn that
with certain exceptions, financial institutions may legally share all of
the information about you and your bank account activity with affiliated
businesses or even third parties." (Washington Post  4 May 99)

PC SALES UP, PROFITS DOWN
Unit sales of PCs rose 21% in April, but revenue declined 2.2% as prices
fell and sales of low-cost PCs surged.  The average sales price of a PC was
$928, according to PC Data Corp.  Sales of sub-$1,000 computers accounted
for 71% of all retail sales.  (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 20 May 99)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

*

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public. 
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just 
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion
 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name
So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.

***This is Project Gutenberg's 29th Fourth of July on the Internet!***
**Help us celebrate by keeping us alive as a continuing institution!**

*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for Wednesday, July 7, 1999*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy
*Check out our Websites at promo.net, and ask me for our FTP servers.*

We have about 50 Etext releases for you in this Newsletter!

With so many entering the Etext field this year, we are one endangered
species I don't think the world can do as well without. . .everyone is
saying they can put a million Etexts online, but none of them actually
have DONE even a thousand. . .they mostly just copy from others. . .as
much as I *LIKE* having our files copied around the world. . .I do NOT
want that to be our undoing. . .if you can help, please read below!!!!

There are nearly 50 new Etexts listed below, all but one produced by a
volunteer corps at Project Gutenberg; you won't find that kind of text
production anywhere else, and we are now in our 29th year of doing it.

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Anniversary News Items:

1.  More Languages [Japanese, Chinese, Swedish, Danish, DNA. . .more.]
2.  The Human Genome Project [11% complete at 375 Megabytes]
3.  We need help getting incorporated as a 501 (C) 3, need a lawyer.
    [We had a volunteer lawyer, but lost email contact]
4.  We need help getting major grants. . .grant writers needed!
5.  We need help with Public Relations. . .I lost the address
    of our new PR person in the big crash, please email me again!
6.  New site at:  www.instinct.org/gutenberg/
7.  New source for Project Gutenberg CDROMs.
8.  We have a new German/Fraktur Team. . .and we need volunteers.
9.  We still need help finished up Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

*

But First. . .Current Requests for Assistance From Our Volunteers:

1.  We still need PERL writers, and I lost my list of them in the crash.

2.  The 1999 CIA World Factbook should be completed just about now;
if any of you can send me a copy, it would be greatly appreciated.

3.  We may still need more proofers for Anna Karenina; will those
currently working on it please contact me.

4.  We have a copy of Martin Luther's publication of the Bible,
in German fractur. . .and will need some serious help on it. . . .
I would LIKE to think there is already an Etext of it available,
if anyone can help us find it.

5.  From:   "Whiting, Jenifer" <jenifer.whiting@PTSEM.EDU>
A request for the text "The Flying Inn" by G.K. Chesterton
Most likely found in older editions in UK and Australia,
but any edition that credits its content as originally
from before 1923 will do just fine.  Her copy was stolen,
along with lots of other things, in a car break in. . .mh
[I think we have a copy coming, but this was not confirmed]


6.  I am working on a 4 volume collection of Samuel Adams' writings
(H. A. Cushing, ed., 1904). The collection covers the years 1764-1802.

I would like to thank Richard Fane and Daniel Moore for all their work
getting  volume III done, and half of volume IV.  We can still use several
scanners and especially proofreaders in order to be able to do volumes I
and II.

Even a few pages of proofreading would be helpful.

If you can help, please email me:
Regina Azucena <razucena@netway.com>


7.  The Human Genome Project:  we are going to need volunteers
to help us with this, unless we can find a way to FTP those 24
chromosomes directly into our /etext00 directories. . .*these*
files are large. . .more details below.

[Different Numbering System for Requests than other items]


8. Found an etext of The Golden Bowl by Henry James,
http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/goldenbowl1.html
If anyone can find a pre-1923 matching paper edition,
then we can post it.


*

1.  More Languages [Japanese, Chinese, Swedish, Danish, DNA. . .more.]

1.  We would LOVE to post one file in a language we have not worked
with before in each of the remaining months of 1999, and perhaps in
2000, if we can.  No matter what format, we are willing to post it,
but would also like to post in the simplest possible format as well
. . .when this is possible.  We may still need help with posting
our Swedish and Danish Bibles. . .just to make sure we haven't
mangled the files.


2.  The Human Genome Project [11% complete at 375 Megabytes]

2.  If you would like to join our Human Genome Project Team,
please email Eliana Brown at one of the following, and cc:me
Eliana Brown <eliana_b68@yahoo.com><brown12@students.uiuc.edu>
We need help getting them to prairienet.org, and perhaps with
putting the headers on them. . .the files are large. . .and we
don't have an easy internal way to get them there. . .thanks!


We have successfully downloaded our first chromosomes, and the
smallest one we could, the Y chromosome, is 3.5 Megabytes.  We
have reserved 26 slots for June, 2000, for the 24 files and a
few instructions and commentaries on how to read and use them.
This will eventually total some 3.38 Gigabytes, so we could use
some programming help to create a compression program that would
take only 2 bits to store any of the GATC amino acids, and would
unpack them for our readers. . .otherwise this one item will at
least quadruple the size of Project Gutenberg.  Zip is currently
compressing at 70%, I have not tried the higher compression zip
options yet. . . .  However, even if we represented each character
with two bits, it would be hard to get much beyond 75%, unless we
used a particularly good algorithm.  We tried one combination of
our own plus zip and got 77%. . .not sure if worth the hassle.


3.  We need help getting incorporated as a 501 (C) 3, need a lawyer.
    [We had a volunteer lawyer, but lost email contact]

This would probably be done in Illinois, and it is obvious we need
to do this, or we won't get the donations required to do more than
our original goal of 10,000 books. . .we are currently doing Etext
at a rate that will reach 3,333 by the end of 2001. . .not bad for
an unincorporated bunch of volunteers whose Executive Director has
not had any paychecks for 6 months and probably won't for the next
6 months, and went through this same situation only two years ago.


4.  We need help getting major grants. . .grant writers needed!

We will get our 10,000 Etexts done, whether we receive any funding
of a major nature or not, but we could do 1,000,000 Etexts in just
20 more years, if we could get some 10 million dollar grants.  The
truth is that if we are going to spend time on other than Etext, I
would prefer that we go all out in this direction.


5.  We need help with Public Relations. . .I lost the address
of our new PR person in the big crash, please email me again!
We have an excellent opportunity to be the cover story on the
Sunday Supplement of a very major newspaper, very shortly.  We
did the preliminary interview last weekend, and we should also
prepare a press release for our 2,000th Etext, Human Genome,
and our new language efforts.  Which reminds me, we may still
need help with Swedish and Danish.

6.  You may want to try our new site at:  www.instinct.org/gutenberg/

7.  From Daniel Meyers:  Here's what I'm ready to offer.
The most up-to-date possible, full texts from Project
Gutenberg on a two CD set for $39.95 (+$5.00 S/H).
Interested parties should send e-mail to
gutenberg@monogames.com and they will be notified
when and where they can order on-line.

Project Gutenberg will receive $34.95 of the above amount.
Major credit cards and checks will be accepted.

8.  We have a new German/Fraktur Team. . .and we need volunteers.
Mike Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>  German and Fraktur Team

9.  We still need help finished up Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
Please contact me if you can find any edition from before 1923.

TO TURN ELECTRONIC PAPER INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Though emphasizing "it won't be on the market in the next year," an
executive of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center says that Xerox and 3M have
signed a manufacturing agreement intended to turn electronic paper into a
commercial product, to be used in such applications as electronic
newspapers capable of adding late-breaking news as you read them.  Like a
computer screen but not much thicker than ordinary paper and almost as
flexible, electronic paper uses "gyricon" display technology developed at
Xerox PARC about ten years ago.  You'll (eventually) be able to write on it
with a wand or stylus or to put it through a computer printer.

 "PC AS SIMPLE AS A TOASTER" - THE $199 iToaster
A personal computer called the iToaster (because its developers say it's as
simple to operate as a toaster) will use the BeOS operating system, rather
than Microsoft's Windows.  Priced at $199 (without a monitor) and
manufactured by Microworkz.com in Seattle, the iToaster will offer word
processing, home finance, and Web browsing software, and will have a
graphical interface.  The company is reportedly in talks with America
Online about potential cross-marketing arrangements.  (MSNBC 21 Jun 99,

THE FIGHT OVER INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION
Those who want to see the business of domain name registration opened up to
competition will have to wait at least three weeks longer, as tensions
build among the three major players in the discussion.  Those players are:
first, the Clinton Administration; second, Icann (Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers), the organization the Administration created to
assume responsibility for Internet administration;  and, third, Network
Solutions Inc. (NSI), the private company which since 1993 has had  the
exclusive worldwide right to assign all Internet addresses ending  with the
suffixes .com, .net, or .org.  NSI is refusing to sign the contract Icann
has developed, saying it gives more Icann more power than the
Administration had intended;  in particular, NSI is claiming sole ownership
to the rights of its database of more than 5 million registered domain
names.  Commerce Department staffer Becky Burr is optimistic that the
dispute will be resolved soon: "I believe it is in everybody's best
interest not to swing threats around."  In the meantime, Icann interim
president Mike Roberts notes, "It's great political theater."  (New York
Times 28 Jun 99)

IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF INFO TECH PROFESSIONALS?
A survey conducted on the Web site of Computer magazine to determine
attitudes about the shortage of information technology professionals found
that 54% of the 84 respondents believe that such a shortage indeed exists
and that liberal immigration policies are generally a good idea;  36% deny
that there's a shortage, and are convinced that corporate America is simply
claiming one so that it can import less expensive workers instead of
investing in the U.S. workforce.  The rest of the respondents say that the
global economy has created a new and complex problem which requires new
kinds of solutions.  (Computer May/Jun 99)

"WHO WANTS TO KNOW?"  (CUSTOMIZED HISTORY FROM ENCARTA)
Today's Wall Street Journal reports that the nine different editions of
Microsoft's Encarta multimedia encyclopedia sometimes give different
answers to the same question.  For example, the U.S., U.K, and German
editions say the inventor of the telephone was Alexander Graham Bell,
whereas the Italian version says the inventor was the impoverished
Italian-American candle maker Antonio Meucci.  Other editions vary on who
invented the electric light bulb, who discovered the virus that causes
AIDS, and other such things.  Microsoft says its editorial teams are made
up of local experts, and company chief executive Bill Gates argued in 1997:
 "In the long run, exposing people to worldwide perspectives should be
healthy.  Americans benefit from a better understanding of the Asian or
European view of important cultural and scientific events, and vice versa."

TRACKING ANONYMOUS SPAM
If you hate getting all those "Make Money Fast At Home!!!" messages from
people who use hard-to-trace or false return addresses, you might want to
use the services of www.spamcop.net, a Web site that allows you to take
action against unsolicited junk e-mail messages sent out in bulk
quantities.  Spam Cop is able to dissect the header information on such
messages, identify where they've come from, and send a message of complaint
to the network administer of the Internet service provider the spammer is
using.  (New York Times Circuits Section 24 Jun 99)

THREE WEEK DELAY IN OPENING UP INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION
The process to open the registration of Internet domain names to
competition has been delayed three weeks due to continued
tensions between the Clinton administration, monopoly-holder
Network Solutions, and would-be overseer ICANN.  Many have
accused ICANN of abusing its power, particularly by holding
closed meetings and by assigning a $1 annual fee to every domain
name registered.  Many were also angered by ICANN's threat to
terminate Network Solutions' authority to register new Internet
addresses, although ICANN has since admitted that only the
Commerce Department holds that authority.  Government officials
such as Virginia's Representative Thomas J. Bliley and Governor
James Gilmore, as well as lobbyists on behalf of Network
Solutions, have demanded investigations into the process of
choosing board members and ICANN's authority to charge the $1
fee.  Other major issues to be resolved include the question of
ownership regarding Network Solutions' user database, the terms
of ICANN's authority, and the prices that businesses must pay
Network Systems to administer the central registry.

TEXTBOOK PUBLISHER LAYS PLANS FOR AN INTERNET UNIVERSITY
Academic publishing house Harcourt General is joining the growing
business of distance education.  It plans to expand its online
offerings with three ventures:  Harcourt University; an Internet
high school for students planning to take high-school equivalency
exams; and an e-commerce site called Harcourt.com.  Through its
university, Harcourt may become the first major publishing house
to offer accredited college degrees, pending approval from the
New England Association of Schools and Colleges.  Yet Harcourt
faces much opposition, particularly from college professors
concerned that Internet-based education denies students the
personal interaction central to a traditional learning
experience.  University bookstores and other traditional
distributors may also oppose the venture because it competes with
their sales.  Last, Harcourt will face strong competition from
the companies and universities already providing online courses.
Harcourt maintains that its educational offerings will be unique.
Its university, which may begin to offer courses by September
2000, will teach a range of subjects in arts and sciences.

U.S. EASES RESTRICTIONS ON SELLING FAST PCS TO RUSSIA AND CHINA
President Clinton significantly reduced restrictions on exports
of powerful computers, arguing that technological innovations
have made laptop and desktop PCs as powerful as the
supercomputers produced just a few years ago.  Previously,
companies were required to obtain individual export licenses to
ship computers faster than 10,000 Mtops (Millions of theoretical
operations per second) to a group of countries which include most
of South America, South Korea, South Africa, and much of Southeast
Asia, but Clinton's order increased the limit to 20,000 Mtops.
The old laws also required companies shipping to a category of
countries deemed "proliferation risks" -- such as China and
Russia -- to obtain licenses to ship any computer faster than
2,000 Mtops to military users or 7,000 Mtops for civilian users.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium III chip is rated at about 1,300
Mtops, and versions due out later this year will hit about 2,000
Mtops.  (New York Times 07/02/99)


Y2K SCARE LEADS TO LARGER ADVANCES [_I_ think this is just to
counter the fact that most people will NOT buy computers now,
and for the next 6 months, until the bug date has passed. . .
which will mean HUGE losses for the economy. . . .  mh]

Experts say the Y2K bug may actually benefit companies and the
economy in general, as it forced many firms to completely
overhaul their computer systems and re-engineer their business
processes to become more efficient.  Federal Reserve Governor
Alan Greenspan noted in his June 1 congressional testimony that
the American economy "is displaying a remarkable run of economic
growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in
technology," and many experts say the Y2K bug is to blame.  The
millennium bug gave senior management an urgent deadline for
assessing their computer systems as well as their entire business
processes, resulting in "a dramatic surge in buying" of ERP
systems, which reorganize and integrate a firm's accounting and
other business practices.  Thus many companies' antiquated
business operations have been modernized, merged, and streamlined
to prepare for Y2K, producing benefits such as increased
productivity, improved customer responsiveness, reduced
inventory, and increased efficiency.

U.S. TO MARKET INFO-TECH WORK TO TEENS  [This seesm to be more
PR aimed at "growing the economy" at the expense of the workers.
I know lots of people in this field, and I'm not sure ANY of the
people I hang out with on a daily basis are actually making the
$68,000 "average" salary mentioned in an earlier one of these.
However, it doesn't take too many Bill Gates to up the "average"
beyond any useful meaning. . .perhaps "median" would be better.]

The Department of Commerce next year is planning to launch a
major advertising campaign to convince teenagers to choose a
career in information technology.  The marketing campaign is
intended to help ease the shortage of high-tech workers by
convincing teenagers that computers are "cool" and  to dispel the
"negative 'geek' or 'nerd' stereotype of technical workers,"
according to Commerce Secretary William Daley.  Analysts estimate
that the U.S. tech industry will need more than 1.3 million tech
workers between 1996 and 2000, with California, Texas, and
Virginia being areas that will need workers the most. Among the
steps the Department advises to ease the shortage are forging
closer links between schools and tech companies, improving
methods of teaching math and science in high schools, and
increasing pay for teachers in those fields, and giving tech
workers incentives to fill teaching positions and train older
workers.  (Washington Post 07/01/99)

[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you

and. . .for those who have read this far, some of our support
notes that came in since I lost them in the big crash.

***

But are there really the texts of entire books?
Is it possible?  If yes, it must have been hard work - my admiration!

Keep up your great work.  :)

This is truly one of the greatest things on the net.  I go there all the
time to download and read my favorites.  Thank you so much and yes,
I am one of your fans.

PG has been one of, if not THE, the greatest aids to 'legitimizing'
electronic book publishing of new works.  Without your work to make
classic literature available in electronic format, we'd have a LOT
more difficulty with "But that's not a REAL book" than we do.

You have a LOT of fans here.  PG is one of the greatest things
on the net since the inception of the net.  We can all
only hope to make a large a contribution as you have.

I wish to thank all who have been, or are working on Project Gutenberg
for compiling so many interesting books.  They enable me, a student with
limited financial means to read books that cannot be obtained otherwise.

This is a GREAT! project! I only regret that I just discovered it.
[All the more reason we need to work on getting better PR--HELP!]

I can only thank everyone who've put in the hard work to make
those books available on PG.  In fact, I've read so many. . . .

Most recent read I did was last month, of the Gutenberg version
of "The Insidious Dr Fu Manchu", a fiction novel.

Thanks gang, for all the excellent and invaluable work!

I have read several classics from cover to cover on my trusty
Sharp laptop in the past year. Including PG's Pride and
Prejudice and Villette (I think that was PG)

What Michael Hart and other public domain people are doing is a
work of unprecedented philanthropy: a direct acceleration of
the democratisation of knowledge. They are to be applauded.

All the best, and thanks for all the wonderful
work you have been doing on the project. . . .

As always, please add my thanks to the list...

Michael

New Files

We have a very interesting collection of Etext for you this August.

First, two new languages are introduced, Swedish and Danish, and an
introduction to Etext from Project Runeberg, the very first Project
Project Gutenberg spin-off, which started 7 years ago.  Why did the
introduction take so long, as with the Gutenberg Projekt-DE [we are
also going to introduce you to them] many Etext projects wanted the
opportunity to make it on their own. . .which we were glad to have,
until things had gotten strongly underway.  So we decided to wait a
while, at least until our own Project Gutenberg effort had made the
leap to one or two thousand Etexts of our own.  So, now, in efforts
to create a wider availability of languages on the Internet, we are
cooperating with Project Runeberg, the Gutenberg Projekt-DE and the
other Etext operations working in the public domain, to bring wider
language selections to a wider audience around the world.  I didn't
realize that it was not obvious that downloading from European site
locations was very difficult for persons in South Africa, and South
America, Australia, New Zealand, etc. . .or I would have made a big
effort to make this more obvious to everyone sooner.  This fact was
a big part in securing the cooperation of the other projects, along
with the fact that we are happy give full credit, list URLs and all
other contact information for those who create these Etexts.  We do
not have this information for the Danish Bible, if you can help....

[Yes, there is a double negative three sentences up. . .mh]

In addition to Swedish and Danish, we are also continuing with some
German Etexts, including those from our own volunteers. . .Goethe's
Egmont is available this month, and hopefully at least one Etext in
German each month to come, perhaps two. . .one of our own, plus one
from Projekt Gutenberg-DE.

We also continue our series of Human Genome Project chromosomes, to
include 6 more. . .for a total of 12 of the 24 human chromosomes; I
should add that we have chosen the shortest of the 24 files, to get
things going as easily as possible.  The last one is 50 megabytes!!
And these only add up to about 11% of the whole thing, so if you do
want these, the total will eventually be 3.3G.

In addition, we have two more volumes of our Friedrich series; that
now brings our total to 10 of the 21 volumes by Carlyle.

To bring the introduction to a close, we have Thomas More's Utopia,
along with a few dozen other Etexts you will see listed below.

Due to the way we have indexed these for future convenience, we are
including [all from the year 2000] 6 Etexts from June, 25 of April,
and 12 from March. . .yes, we usually do post a few more than 36 as
the Newsletter comes out on the first Wednesday of the month, so we
have a few days of work from the next month, which I feel we should
include, rather than make you wait an additional month.

I should add a few comments about using http ["The Web"] versus ftp
["The Net"]. . .if you use http, then you have to wait for a "human
being" to index the files for that Web Site. . .unless they have an
automated indexing system, which is usually not the case. . .but if
you use ftp [which you can now do from most Web Browsers, you don't
have to wait for such an index to be built.  However, these indices
are often very valuable in searching for what you want, so I should
strongly recommend you use them when, other then when searching for
the very latest Etexts. . .the indices usually contain everything I
have posted, other than from the most recent Newsletter.  If you do
want to use ftp, keep this Newsletter's contents on file so you can
recognize which filenames you want to get.

AOL TO MICROSOFT:  SORRY, BUT IT'S A PRIVATE PARTY
America Online is trying to block attempts by Microsoft's new MSN Messenger
Service to let Microsoft customers exchange messages instantly with AOL's
community of users. Charging  Microsoft with trespassing on its system, AOL
has erected several software barriers to Microsoft's efforts, prompting
Microsoft to respond to each obstruction by developing an immediate
software workaround.  Forrester Research analyst Tom Rhinelander sees the
argument as "kind of like a food fight, like a couple of juveniles saying
'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can,' 'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can.' ...
AOL will say 'we've got to be careful about security and scalability,' and
all these kinds of things.  But they'll be forced to open up to the other
folks, there's no way around it."  (San Jose Mercury News 27 Jul 99)

INTERNET FEVER SPREADS TO BRITAIN
With British ISP Freeserve PLC enjoying a 37% stock price increase on the
first day of public trading, Britain.is getting its first experience of the
wild Internet success stories now common in the U.S.  Freeserve, which is
now the largest access provider in Britain, developed a business model that
gives customers free access -- and derives its revenue exclusively by
taking a share of phone revenue generated by the cost of the telephone
calls users place to Freeserve.   Unlike the U.S., where phone customers in
most parts of the country can make unlimited local calls for a flat monthly
charge, European phone companies (at least for the present!) charge by
minutes of connect time.  (New York Times 27 Jul 99)
http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/biztech/articles/27net.html

RUSSIAN ISP SAYS "NYET" TO SPYING
Russian Internet service provider Bayard-Slavia is refusing to obey a
directive that gives the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) the right
to examine private e-mail messages without a warrant.  The System of
Efficient Research Measures 2directive also requires ISPs to pay for
surveillance equipment in their servers and for a link to FSB headquarters.
In retaliation for Bayard-Slavia's recalcitrance, the FSB has withdrawn the
ISP's license, frozen its bank account, and is challenging its right to
frequencies for its satellite link to Moscow.  "We will never help the FSB
implement illegal shadowing," says Bayard-Slavia's director general.  "We're
the first ISP to struggle against illegal information collection.
Unfortunately, we're also likely to become the first to be destroyed because
of insubordination."  (Data Communications 26 Jul 99)

INTERNET RIVALS ATTEMPT TO OPEN UP AOL'S INSTANT MESSAGE SYSTEM
A number of Internet service providers aim to establish open
access to America Online's exclusive instant messaging programs.
Instant messaging notifies users when their friends are online
and allows them to type messages to each other.  It is an
increasingly popular form of communication, and with three
services and a total 80 million users, AOL dominates the market.
Yet Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Prodigy each attempted to change this
recently by creating rival services that can communicate with
users of AOL's services.  AOL responded to this threat by
changing its communications protocols, effectively eliminating
the rival programs' access to its service.  While Microsoft has
been able to adjust its software to access AOL, Yahoo! and
Prodigy have not.  The three contend that AOL should open its
technology to facilitate interaction between users of all
services.  Yet AOL argues that because access to its services
was unauthorized, the rival services have breached accepted
security standards.  (Wall Street Journal 07/26/99)

Comments on Our Schedule

A number of people have asked about our current schedule...

My apologies for jumping so far into the future for some of
the files we are currently working on, but putting them all
in a single block in the index really makes it much easier,
for us, and also for those using the raw index I produce in
the first week of each month, relating the postings, events
and other comments from the previous month.

The quick answers:

1.  We are currently about 8 months ahead of our schedule.

2.  We are currently just barely making our schedule of 36
    Etexts per month. . .so we can't increase scheduling.

3.  We reserved space in March, 2000 for a 21 volume set,
    of which we have now completed 11 volumes.  We also
    reserved space in June, 2000, for Human Genome files,
    of which we have now complete 18 chromosomes, but this
    leaves some gaps still to be filled. . .we have just
    finished all the April, 2000, Etexts, and started on
    May. . .all of which you will see indexed below.  If
    possible, I will sneak in the last 6 chromosomes for
    this Newsletter, but it will be very close. . .they
    are big files, and the person who helps me with them
    is unavailable at the moment.

The more detailed answers:

Our current official schedule is to do 36 Etext per month--
I am TRYING to do 40 per month--but it is a tough go at the
moment, with so many of our academic people having been out
for the summer, and not really back in the saddle yet. . .I
am therefore officially sticking to the 36 Etexts per month
schedule, but doing my best to really make it average 40.

If we CAN average 40, we will reach 3,333 Etexts by the end
of 2001. . . .  We were going to try to double production--
every year--but without and serious Public Relations effort
or funding effort, we have still survived, but not expanded
our production much from the 32 Etexts per month we did for
several years. . .this is still more than anyone else but I
do hope can eventually move to 72 per month, and then more.

But this will take some serious PR and financial grant work
. . .if ANY of you are interested, please let me know.

Now. . .having said ALL that. . .we somehow managed a great
deal of extra production during the last 6 months last year
. . .no one seems to have any idea why. . .but we actually,
really did manage to average 72 Etext per month then, so we
ended up about 8 months ahead of schedule. . .since we were
about a month or two ahead when we started that period. . .
we have never quite figured out what happened, and we can't
really change our schedule without the premise that this is
actually possible on a continuing basis, without additional
resources. . .so it is just one of those little mysteries--
and a very nice one to have had.

So. . .we started this year about 7-8 months ahead. . .this
is why we started the Etexts for the year 2000 a few months
ago. . . .  If we manage an extra 4 Etext per month for the
first 9 months or a bit longer we will end up with one more
month done ahead of schedule. . .but even with the 24 files
of the Human Genome Project going in right now, it looks as
if we will have to work pretty hard to achieve that goal.

Notes from Edupage


NAVY OFFICIALS BACK OFF DIRE Y2K FORECAST  [Under Duress]
The Navy issued a statement denying its earlier reports of
expected power failures resulting from the year 2000 (Y2K)
computer bug for nearly 60 Navy and Marine Corps installations.
The first Navy report found the probable and likely failure of
natural gas, electricity, water and sewer utility services in
communities near the installations.  The Navy retracted the
statement, saying it now agrees with the White House assessment,
which states electrical failures will be unlikely in the new
year.  Meanwhile, the Navy has not yet completed verifying Y2K
computer readiness for various Navy and Marine Corps communities.
The Navy posted its original findings on the Internet, but
removed them due to inaccurate and misleading information.  Navy
officials say the database will be put back on the Internet,
accompanied with text explaining the findings.
(Washington Post 08/21/99)

[Here is the original report]

NAVY Y2K REPORT PREDICTS 'LIKELY' UTILITY OUTAGES IN SEVERAL CITIES
A recent updated Navy report predicts that electric utilities
serving nearly 60 of the approximately 400 Navy and Marine
facilities will probably suffer a power outage due to the year
2000 (Y2K) computer bug.  The military report also expected power
failures in several cities, including Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla.; as well as some midwinter natural gas failures in such
places as Fort Worth, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; and Albany, N.Y.
The Navy report is in sharp contrast to other predictions,
including conclusions from the White House.  John
Koskinen--President Clinton's top Y2K advisor--said the Navy's
results were overly cautious and were based on the worst-case
scenario.  (Washington Post 08/20/99)

WIRED ON CAMPUS E-LIFE
Many students are beginning to pick universities based on how
"wired" they are, according to a recent article in USA Today.
This is because students are performing more functions online,
from registering for classes and communicating with professors to
ordering take-out, than ever before.  Of the 15 million students
currently attending a college, 60 percent say they go online
daily, and 85 percent of students own their own computers,
according to research firm Student Monitor.  The company predicts
that university students will spend $700 million online during
the next school year, and over $4 billion online annually by
2002.  (USA Today 08/19/99)

MICROSOFT-AOL WAR HEATS UP OVER NET ACCESS
Though America Online is on top of the online service provider
heap right now, Microsoft is aiming to knock it from its perch.
While AOL continues to charge for its service, Microsoft wishes
to move the market towards free or cheap access.  The company has
tested a $9.95 price point for monthly access fees, and is
mulling over the idea of giving free access to consumers who
agree to spend a certain amount each month with some of
Microsoft's e-commerce partners.  For its part, AOL says that
Microsoft's attempts to undercut monthly charges will ultimately
not be successful, as even deep-pocketed Microsoft cannot afford
to lose money on Internet access forever.  Meanwhile, Microsoft
says its moves against AOL are protective in nature, believing
that in the near future AOL is planning to become an online
software platform to rival Microsoft's Windows.
(Wall Street Journal 08/05/99)

ALTAVISTA OFFERING FREE INTERNET ACCESS
AltaVista Thursday launched a free Internet access service,
becoming the first major Internet site to do so.  The company,
which owns one of the Web's 10 most visited sites, hopes to
attract more customers by providing free Internet access.
Although AltaVista will lose subscription revenues, the company
believes increased ad revenues will compensate for the loss.
AltaVista users will be required to begin their Web surfing from
the AltaVista home page, and will have an ad constantly in the
corner of their computer screens.  In addition, a MicroPortal
will appear on the screen that contains banner ads as well as
links to shopping and search sites.  Although AltaVista will not
sell consumer registration information, it will use the data to
customize ads to a user's interests, says AltaVista spokesperson
David Emmanuel.  (USA Today 08/13/99)

Notes from Newsscan Daily



CLEVELAND FREE-NET CLOSES DOWN
Cleveland Free-Net, which was the nation's first free community computer
network, will shut down this Fall rather go through the effort and expense
of reprogramming the system to make it Y2K-compliant. One long-time user of
the Free-Net, which started in 1984 as an electronic bulletin board at Case
Western Reserve University, said:  "It's just sad to see it go.  It's an
institution."  (AP/San Jose Mercury News 5 Aug 99)

CRYPTOGRAPHER DESIGNS SUPER-CODE-CRACKING COMPUTER
Cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel has
designed a computer that uses light-emitting diode technology to crack
512-bit encryption keys in just two or three days.  A recent effort to crack
465-bit keys took hundreds of computers and several months.  Twinkle, which
stands for The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine, measures the light
from the diodes to perform the mathematical calculations necessary to
decrypt the keys.  The computer, if built, would cost about $2 million, and
could jeopardize the security of the majority of electronic commerce
underway today.  Longer keys, with 1,024-bits, are now used for highly
sensitive documents, but the most popular browsers used for transactions
today are set for only 512 bits.  (Wall Street Journal 16 Aug 99)

TIPTOEING THROUGH THE WEB
Privada Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is offering a new service that allows
users to make all of their Internet activities - e-mail, online chats, Web
browsing and e-commerce transactions - completely anonymous.  The Web
Incognito service encrypts the data flowing from the subscriber's Internet
service provider and masks its origins before sending it on to its intended
destination.  The service, which can be switched on and off by the user,
also stores the subscriber's "cookies."  Web Incognito differentiates itself
from other privacy products in that it covers all Internet activities - not
just Web browsing or e-mail - and has said it will share the identity of
users with law enforcement authorities who have appropriate warrants.  "Our
service is for protecting the privacy of consumers, not for hiding criminals
or criminal activities," says Privada CEO Barbara Bellissimo.  "We felt it
would be irresponsible not to give law enforcement agencies the information
if they have valid warrants."  (New York Times 16 Aug 99)

BROADCOM'S 10-IN-1 NETWORKING CHIP
Broadcom Corp. has developed a new networking chip that can perform tasks
now handled by up to 10 separate chips.  The StrataSwitch chip boasts 60
million transistors and is capable of analyzing the content of data
transmissions and assigning higher priority to those packets containing
voice and video.  "What this represents is basically the world's first true
switching system on a single chip," says the general manager of Broadcom's
networking business unit.  (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 16 Aug 99)

SBC TO OFFER E-MAIL-ONLY PHONE SERVICE  [Not only SBC. . .so news says]
SBC Communications plans a September launch for its new eMessage service --
designed for people who want to communicate online, but don't want to use a
computer to do it.  The service will use a portable phone attachment that
includes a keyboard and screen.  The e-mail-only service marks the first
time a major phone company has offered a service geared especially toward
the "Internet appliance" market.  The eMessage service will cost about $10 a
month, and the device will sell for about $180 - about half the price of Web
phones.  (Los Angeles Times 19 Aug 99)

NET ENEMIES LIST
Reporters Sans Frontiers, a Paris-based organization that promotes press
freedom, has compiled a Top-20 list of countries that severely restrict
citizens' access to information on the Internet.  They are: Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Libya, North
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.  Most of the countries named have
state-owned Internet service providers that filter and censor Web sites for
their citizens, and more repressive regimes, like Burma's, require computer
owners to register with the government.  A few, like North Korea and Iraq,
have almost no Internet access at all.  And in Saudi Arabia, the Internet is
viewed as "a harmful force for Westernizing people's minds."  (Investor's

INSTANT MESSAGING
Prodigy, Tribal Voice and PeopleLink have agreed to give their customers the
ability to instantly exchange notes with the 1.3 million users of the
Microsoft Network's instant message service. This accommodation with
Microsoft is in stark contrast to the position taken by America Online,
which has repeatedly counterattacked Microsoft's attempt to link its own
service with AOL's to allow instant communication between Microsoft and AOL
customers.  (San Jose Mercury News 18 Aug 99)
http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/ap/docs/764802l.htm

JUDGE NIXES AOL TRADEMARK ATTEMPT
A federal judge has rejected America Online's attempt to prohibit AT&T from
using the terms "You have mail," "Buddy List," and "IM" on its WorldNet
service.  AOL had claimed that the words and phrases were trademarked.
"We're pleased the court agreed that these terms are in the public domain -
available for all to use," says AT&T General Counsel Jim Cicconi.  "AOL's
claim that it owns the everyday language of the Internet is another example
of AOL's attempt to monopolize all aspects of services over the Internet."
AOL says it will appeal the ruling and its general counsel is "confident
that the ruling will be reversed."  (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 17
Aug 99)   http://www.latimes.com/HOME/BUSINESS/t000073171.html

PRIVACY ADVOCATES COMPLAIN ABOUT AMAZON'S "FUN FEATURE"
Amazon.com says its new "Purchase Circle" feature is "a fun way for people
to find out what others are buying yet maintain individual confidentiality,"
but privacy advocates think it's a step in the wrong direction.  The feature
allows people to see what the most popular books are among Amazon patrons at
any large organization;  for example, "Memories of a Geisha" is now No. 1 at
Charles Schwab, and "The End of Marketing As We Know It" at CocaCola. Web
design expert Jacob Nielsen says, "From a privacy perspective, it's very
scary.  It's a true Big Brother phenomenon." The feature can not be used to
learn what individuals are reading;  the company only makes public reading
profiles of groups that include at least several hundred individuals. [No
inferences are drawn from the popularity of particular books at particular
institutions.] David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center
says, "People don't like the idea that their purchases are being turned into
profiles, and they certainly don't like the idea that information is turned
over to third parties, even it it's not personally identifiable."  (USA
Today 26 Aug 99) http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/ctf950.htm

ICANN AGAIN REJECTS REQUEST FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERSHIPS
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has for the
second time rejected a request for representation by a number of persons who
own Internet domain names as individuals rather than as corporations or
other organizations. ICANN, now meeting in Chile, has been accused of
letting its decision-making activities be biased in the interests of large
organizations that can afford to send their representatives all over the
world. (New York Times Cybertimes 26 Aug 99)
http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/08/cyber/articles/26domain.html

FORTY MOVIES ON A SINGLE DISK
Japan's Science & Technology Agency and Sharp Corp. have developed a 12-inch
(30.5 cm) memory disk that can store 200 gigabytes of data, which is enough
to store 40 times more data than a digital video disk (DVD), or the
equivalent of 40 two-hour movies. The new disk and disk drive will not be
available commercially for at least three years.  (San Jose Mercury News 26

PLAIN VANILLA INTERNET ACCESS
Swedish ISP BIP Bottnia Internet Provider is giving Internet service away
for free to customers who buy ice cream from Hemglass trucks. "All visitors
to the Hemglass trucks will be able to pick up a free Internet subscription
as a fun extra offer," says the head of marketing at Hemglass. The company's
200 trucks make 15,000 stops every day, reaching 90% of all Swedish
households. (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 26 Aug 99)

LONDON FIRM CHALLENGES HACKERS
London-based Global Market is offering $50,000 to anyone who can crack its
high-security "1on1" service. The service includes a special feature called
autoshredder, which allows users to order an e-mail message to delete itself
from the recipient's computer at a specified time, leaving no trace. "There
are other companies offering security, not quite to the same extent as us,
and not to the same level of security. Nobody else offers the self-destruct
e-mail," says Steven James, the company's technical director.

AOL LAUNCHES FREE UK INTERNET SERVICE
In an effort to squelch upstart British rival Freeserve, America Online has
launched its own subscription-free service in the U.K.  Freeserve's free
Internet access model has been copied by about 200 other service providers
in the U.K. over the last year, causing British consumers to lose interest
in subscription-based ISPs. In a further attempt to clone the Freeserve
model, AOL Europe has linked with retail giant Kingfisher to distribute the
free service. Freeserve uses parent company Dixons' outlets to sell its
software. (Financial Times 25 Aug 99)

The "On-Line Books Page" allows you to search titles and authors
of nearly 10,000 books on sites all over the Internet, including
Project Gutenberg.  Try  http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/
This should have over 10,000 listings by the time you get there.


Requests

Some time ago, after a request made by Michael Hart, a few volunteers
helped posting on PG the Spanish literature masterwork Don Quijote de la
Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes. I think that this could be a good opportunity
to continue posting etexts in Spanish but we need help from people wanting
to volunteer. I do not have much time to dedicate to the effort alone, so I
ask anyone wanting to help to contribute to contact Michael or myself in
order to create a "stable" group (like the one that does German etexts, for
example) on Spanish texts. Basically what we need is someone who has time
enough to become a "leader" of the team (I can help a little if needed),
proofers (to check scanned or already digitized texts) and/or searchers
for copyright matters.  We would appreciate any help on this.

Comments About Our New Files

This month we have completed our first draft of the Human Genome. If you
have some interest in this area, we are working on a search program. . .
to locate "conserved sequences/motifs" as well as specific genes.  Also,
if you would like to write an article about the Human Genome. . .or know
anyone who would, or who would like to play with the program, email me.

We have also gotten back on track with our calendar. . .having completed
the rather large extra tasks we set for ourselves a few months ago.  You
will notice [at least while I am writing this, that there are full month
scheduled releases this month. . .and three from next month.

NEW HANDHELD COMPUTER TO COMPETE AGAINST PALMPILOT
The creators of the PalmPilot handheld computer, who left their former
company to form a new one called Handspring, are about to compete against
the PalmPilot. Called "Visor," their new device will be sold in modular
versions starting at $149 and will be aimed at both the consumer and office
markets. Various modules will enable the Visor to work as a digital camera,
music player, pager, and wireless telephone. (Reuters/New York Times 10 Sep 99)

BRITISH TELECOM OFFERS FREE PCs
British Telecom has become the first U.K. Internet service provider to offer
customers a free personal computer as part of its BT Internet PC package.
The package, which costs 25.99 British pounds a month, also includes
installation, training, and free weekend ISP connections. At the end of
three years, customers will own their Fujitsu PC. BT says its new service
will cost less than 90p a day, and noted that the free weekend connections
would eliminate the potential problem of children running up phone bills
during peak Internet usage times.  (Associated Newspapers Ltd. 14 Sep 99)

WRITERS WIN INTERNET COPYRIGHT SUIT IN CHINA
In the first case of its kind in China, a group of six prominent writers has
been awarded compensatory damages for having their work published without
their permission. The court ruled that Century Internet Communications
Technology Co. had violated the writers' copyrights by putting their works
on Beijing Online's Web site.  The writers will receive anywhere from 720
yuan ($87) to 12,380 yuan (about $1,480) each. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury
News 22 Sep 99) http://www.sjmercury.com/


FREELANCERS' PERMISSION NEEDED TO POST ELECTRONICALLY
A federal appeals-court panel has ruled that publishers must receive
permission from freelance writers, musicians, photographers and artists
before putting their material online or onto CD-ROMs, and must pay them
extra compensation for the privilege unless otherwise contractually
negotiated. The original suit was filed in 1993 by six writers who accused
several media companies, including the New York Times, Time Warner's Sports
Illustrated, Times Mirror's Newsday, and Reed-Elsevier's Lexis/Nexis
database, of copyright infringement for reproducing their work online
without permission. A federal court judge in 1997 sided with the publishers,
saying that electronic databases are simply revised versions of original
publications and that copyright law doesn't require extra payment by
publishers. The appeals-court panel on Friday found that databases differ
significantly because they contain thousands or millions of individual
articles that can be retrieved without reference to the original
publication. Most media companies today require "all rights" contracts,
which explicitly include electronic reproduction, but the real problem for
media organizations, says attorney Bruce Keller, is what should be done
about articles written during the 20 years prior to this case.

PHONES OUTNUMBER UMBRELLAS IN LOST-AND-FOUND
Londoners are leaving up to 45 mobile phones on buses and trains every day
-- outnumbering the number of umbrellas left behind for the first time ever.
According to Maureen Beaumont, manager of London Transport's lost property
office, the number of handsets being turned in is up sharply: "It's just
creeping up and up and up. It was just 30 a day a couple of months ago. Now
we're up to 40 or 45 a day." This year so far, there are 4,000 abandoned
phones waiting to be claimed, but because many users have insurance policies
that replace their phones within a few days, most of the misplaced handsets
are just left in the lost property office for the requisite six months.
"After that we can sell them as a piece of hardware -- we just dispose of
the sim card," says Beaumont. (Financial Times 27 Sep 99)

WIRED CITIES
An Ohio State University study has identified the 20 "most
Internet-accessible" U.S. cities: 1, Washington, DC; 2, Chicago; 3, Dallas;
4, New York; 5, Atlanta; 6, San Jose; 7, Los Angeles; 8, Houston; 9, San
Francisco; 10, Phoenix; 11, Boston; 12, Seattle; 13, Philadelphia; 14, St.
Louis; 15, Denver; 16, Baltimore; 17, Minneapolis; 18, Palo Alto; 19,
Detroit; 20, Santa Clara. The authors say, "In general, cities with more
linkages to the Internet backbone will have faster access and more reliable
connections to global information. This enhanced access results in a
comparative advantage that will grow in importance with the continuing
computerization of information." (Newsbytes News Network/USA Today 24 Sep 99)

MICROSOFT'S IE5 REELING AGAIN AFTER TWO NEW BUGS DISCOVERED
Experts this week found two new security bugs that affect
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 (IE5) browser.  Security expert
Georgi Guninski discovered one spoofing glitch that would give
hackers access to data on IE5 even through a firewall.  The bug
would allow an HTML JavaScript to activate once a user visits a
Web site, and then download files back to the user's computer.
Since the files are downloaded from the computer back to itself
rather than to another machine, firewalls do not prevent the
attack.  After the information has been downloaded back to the
original computer, it can be sent to any IP address.  Microsoft
is now working on a patch, and suggests in the meantime that
concerned users disable IE5's active scripting.  A second bug,
confirmed this week by BugNet and its parent company KeyLabs,
would allow IE5's rendering engine to alter HTML tags.  HTML tags
could change when users working with IE5 and Microsoft's MSHTML
editing and rendering engine use the "Web Page, complete" default
setting.  Microsoft is working to repair the problem, and
suggests for now that users rely on the "Web Page, HTML only"
setting.  (InfoWorld Electric 09/29/99)

STUDY: HIGH COST FOR WINDOWS 2000 TRANSITION
The migration costs of Microsoft's Windows 2000 are so high that
companies implementing the operating system would be unlikely to
see a return on investment for at least three years, according to
a recent Gartner Group study.  The report indicates that the
migration cost for Windows 2000 could amount to as much as $3,100
per PC.  Gartner vice president Michael Gartenberg says by the
time a company would see a return on Windows 2000, it would be
time to switch to another operating system.  Microsoft has
advertised Windows 2000 as offering "increased reliability,
availability, and scalability with end-to-end management features
that reduce operating costs."  Microsoft studies indicate
companies migrating to Windows 2000 will see benefits
immediately.  Microsoft concedes that migration can be expensive,
but says Windows 2000 can significantly reduce operating costs by
streamlining help-desk operations, improving PC manageability,
and offering businesses greater control over software
applications.  (C|Net 09/09/99)

CUT IN FIBER CABLE DISRUPTS INTERNET TRAFFIC NATIONWIDE
Internet traffic throughout the country was slowed dramatically
yesterday after a fiber cable was cut.  A gas company in Ohio
inadvertently cut the cable with a backhoe at about noon
yesterday.  Traffic between the East and West Coasts was as much
as 50 times slower than usual.  Some companies experienced so
much trouble that they had no choice but to close down.  Although
fiber cuts occur occasionally, a cut to such a large cable is
unusual, according to Bill Woodcock, a network architect for
regional ISP Zocalo.  The cable was transmitting 40 billion bits
per second.  Traffic that would usually move through the cable
was rerouted, but the congestion that resulted slowed data moving
through other network segments.  GTE, which owned segments of the
cut cable, said last night that the cable would probably be fixed
by 9 p.m.  (New York Times 09/30/99)

EXPERTS FEAR AN OUTBREAK OF Y2K VIRUSES
Computer security experts are concerned about a possible outbreak
of Y2K viruses after two Y2K-related viruses appeared last week.
Experts say Y2K hoaxes, viruses that are spread via
Y2K-remediation software, and viruses designed to first appear on
January 1, 2000, are among the dangers associated with the
beginning of the new millennium.  A new "Trojan Horse" virus
appeared last week in the guise of an e-mail offering a free year
2000 countdown clock.  Once activated, the virus enters the
computer's Internet connection to gain access to the user's
passwords and account numbers.  The other virus appearing last
week, called W32/Fix2001, arrives as a note from the "system
administrator" and claims to provide software for fixing a Y2K
Internet problem.  If launched, the virus will attach itself to
all future e-mail transmissions.  Although experts say both
viruses are not considered major threats, future viruses could
be.  (San Francisco Chronicle 09/20/99)

BRITISH PUBLISHER PUTS BOOKS ONLINE
Dorling Kindersley, a educational book and CD-ROM publisher, says it's
planning to put all of its material online, allowing customers to view
entire books online before they decide whether to purchase. The move signals
the bookseller's attempt to replicate the experience of shopping in a
bricks-and-mortar bookstore: "People want to be able to look inside books
just as they would in a store," says Alan Buckingham, managing director of
Dorling Kindersley Online. The company hopes to have 10% of its holdings
online by January. Executive Chairman Peter Kindersley acknowledges that
customers could print out the pages they need rather than buy the entire
text, but says that risk is small in comparison to the benefits of brand
awareness: "It is highly unlikely someone will print out a whole book
because the cost of printer cartridges is extremely high."

Headline News


I just finished watching Biography's "100 Most Influential People of the
Millennium" and our dear Mr. Gutenberg was #1!!!   No question - good choice.
Thought you might like to know - on behalf of all us Gutenbergers!
From: Hoost0811@aol.com


"Just got the Nov. 8 issue of TIME Magazine today --- focused on the 21st
century.  And I was delighted to see Michael Hart profiled as a visionary
in People to Watch' on p. 14."  From Richard Seltzer   ["People To Watch"
is a new column in TIME, we made the top of their list, chosen as to lead
off what they hope will be a permanent feature.]


We should also be the cover story for the Chicago Tribune Sunday Supplement
on November 21st. . .this article has been in progress since March and they
say it should be the best one of these they have done in well over a year.
We shall see, eh?


Given that we are today releasing about 75 new Etexts, we are now approaching
being 10 months ahead of schedule. . .our current goal is to get to 12 months
. . .actually 12 1/2 months. . .ahead of schedule by the end of 2001, to have
3,333 Project Gutenberg Etexts online at that time. . .about 1/3 of that goal
we originally started with. . .but. . .that goal also included a prediction I
made that the other Etext producers would be happy to put their public domain
Etexts on our servers and help us do the appropriate copyright research.  The
truth is that one of the things we need is a liaison person to coordinate our
efforts with the handful of other major Etext producers so we can provide the
10,000 Etexts now available in a proper manner through our worldwide servers.
So, if you are the kind of person who can do this, please. . .let us know!!!

Comments About Our New Files

First a correction to an earlier comment:

I chose it because my goal was to change the way information is
passed from person to person as much as Johannes Gutenberg did.
He reduced the price of books to 1/400th of their previous cost
which was equal to that of the average family farm beforehand!!
Now you can buy a 25G hard drive for $300. . .and you **could**
put 5 thousand copies of the Complete Works of Shakespeare on a
drive like that, without compression. . .that's 6 cents a copy!
There are terabyte drive packs on the way, that will cost less,
and will hold just about every word in even a *large* library!!
It will not so many of these to hold the Library of Congress!!!
I have heard estimates from 2 to 20 terabytes. . .but when such
terabytes are as common as gigabytes are now. . .who will care?


Comments About Our New Files

We lead off this Newsletter Index with Uncle Remus, in honor of
the movie "Song of the South". . .which has been removed from a
circulating feature [I think by Disney] because of "politically
incorrect" catcalls from certain political action committees.

Millions of students saw this movie as "required viewing" in an
era before this kind of political pressure, but which had an
entirely different "politically incorrect" venue known as:

"The McCarthy Era Witch Hunts"

which didn't seem to be have the kind of power now wielded by a
wide range of groups who could be called politically incorrect,
themselves.  Rewriting history, particularly history that was a
"staple" in our educational system, is totally incorrect.  I do
understand that in any history there are events and values that
should not be passed on but neither should they be passed over.
By pretending these things never happened we do NOT encourage a
proper perspective, either by these committees, or on the parts
of the people more directly involved.


Meanwhile, our German Team continues to amaze me. . . .

Several more additions are listed below, and more on the way!!

I hope they are an inspiration to those considering helping us
do Etexts in other languages. . .it took us forever to get the
German Team rolling, and now. . .fantastic. . .please help get
us rolling with other languages!!!

FCC CHAIR TO WORLDCOM:  NOT SO FAST THERE
A statement by Federal Communications Commission chairman William E. Kennard
indicates that MCI WorldCom may have some difficulty getting FCC approval of
its $129-billion acquisition of Sprint:  "Competition has produced a price
war in the long-distance market. This merger appears to be a surrender. How
can this be good for customers? The parties will bear a heavy burden to show
how consumers would be better off." (Washington Post 6 Oct 99)

Participants translate each week's assignments, and then have the opportunity
to compare their translations with other participants' work.  For more

Blackstone's Commentaries Request

Is this doable?  I just got the first of four volumes (I'm not sure when
I'll be able to afford the other three -- they're about $16 each) of the
paperback facsimile edition the University of Chicago Press put out in 1979.
The facsimile title page says it was published in Oxford in M.DCC.LXV.  It
has "s"s that look like "f"s, footnotes all over the place, and lots of
French and Latin phrases scattered thru it, all in Italics.  Each volume is
about 500 pp.  So I ask again, is this doable?

From: "K. Kay Shearin" <poach@ezol.com>

It's William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of
the First Edition of 1765-1769, from The University of Chicago Press,
copyright 1979.

There's a hardbound edition, too, but in paperback the ISBNs are:

Vol. 1:  0-226-05538-8 (this is the one I have)
Vol. 2:  0-226-05541-8
Vol. 3:  0-226-05543-4
Vol. 4:  0-226-05545-0

The intro says it's "the most important legal treatise ever written in the
English language," and this "edition is meant to make the book available to
students and scholars in an accurate, accessible, and inexpensive form," so
it really does belong on Gutenberg, so I don't feel guilty about pulling
strings to get it there.  (Of course, I can't remember the last time I did
something on purpose that I did feel guilty about.)

From: "Oliver.C.Colt. " <colt@guernsey.net>

Dear Professor Hart.   Some time ago I sent you a transcript of a tale
written by Tolstoy and translated by Aylmer Maude, the title being "A
prisoner in the Caucuses".  There was some uncertainty about the
copyright position, as the book from which I had taken this was
published in the U.K. in 1931.  However, I find that this translation and
others by Aylmer Maude were being published long before that in a
variety of publications.  It occurs to me that if the matter is investigated
it might well be that the story could be used in P.G. without infringing
any copyright. May I suggest that if you are interested you set your
bloodhounds on the trail,  unless you feel quite sure that a search would
be pointless.

From:  Sandra Laythorpe. slaythorpe@cwcom.net
Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823-1901) lived in the village of Otterbourne,
Hampshire, England, all her life. She was a friend of John Keble, founder of
The Oxford Movement, and would have known Florence Nightingale, who was a
near neighbour, and other notables.  She was a very popular novelist, but
her books are little read nowadays, because they are considered by modern
critics to be sentimental and narrow.  Her most popular work is 'The Heir of
Redclyffe' (1853), which has recently been reprinted.  Miss Yonge was a
woman of her time, and records the lives of families living through the
great social changes of the 19th Century.  I think her works are ideal for
the Gutenberg Project, because they are important social records, have been
neglected for nearly 100 years, and they deserve to have a wider reading
audience.  My personal interest began because I live about 2 miles from her
house, she was a well known local benefractress.  I have enjoyed her books
very much, and I think her insights into human nature and spirituality are
quite amazing.  I intend to start with her most popular works, I believe she
wrote about 160 novels.  Most of her work is available in Hampshire County
Library, so they are easily accessible to me.  ***get more***

[A word of explanation--ALL the texts for the entire 8 volumes WERE posted in
the 2 volume names listed below. . .this was because I did not understand the
structure of the index entries I received until the last minute, and I wanted
to go ahead and make the files available then.   In today's Newsletter. . .we
have divided these up into the 8 volumes. . .so if you want to keep them in a
larger file format, keep the old files. . . .for as of now the same filenames
for volumes 1 and 2 will actually only contain 1 volume each/did have 4 each]

Subject: Zane Grey book available

Michael:

In addition to the previous 6 books, I have a copy of Zane Grey's _The
Last Trail_ [TAKEN!] available for someone to work with.

B. M. Bower, _Casey Ryan_
             _The Gringos_
             _Skyrider_
Frances Hodgson Burnett, _In Connection with the DeWilloughby Claim_
W. W. Jacobs, _Many Cargoes_
H. G. Wells, _The Undying Fire_  TAKEN!


Time to run the copyright rules by them again, and also have had a couple
of complaints about the how-to input directions being wordy. I thought I
re-wrote them, but that's not what's at the site. Remind me again when the
time comes if you want me to do it.

A PROPOSAL FOR PUBLISHING PROJECT GUTENBERG BOOKS IN HTML

by philip Hunt <phil@comuno.com>

There is a problem in that PG books are currently on the web
site in ascii, but the prefered format for web-basded information
is HTML. One solution would be to copy all the books into HTML.
However, this would present other problems, such as:

(1) what about other data formats such as WAP, RTF, DocBook,
MSWord, PDF, etc? Will we want to transcribe all existing PG
books into these formats as well?

(2) what about new PG books? We don't want to have to manually
enter the same book multiple times, once for each format.

(3) HTML is popular now, but will it be in 10 years time? Will
something else be popular then? We don't want to have to keep
re-translating.

These problems can be solved by translating them not into HTML,
but into an XML-based format.

I envisage that most of ther work in translation can be done
programmatically -- I plan writing a few experimental Python scripts
to do this over the next few weeks.

Of course, it is necessary to define exactly what the XML-based format
will look like (i.e. what tags to use, and their meaning). My preference
would be for something quite simple: <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3> to define
types of paragraph, <i> and <b> to define italic and boldface, and
<pre> to define preformated text. As you probably know, these are the same
tags that HTML uses.

Once the data is in the XML format, translating to the other formats I
mentioned above will be easy, i.e. it will be able to be done entirely
automatically once the right programs are written. I do not envisage these
programs as being difficult to write. So once a book is in XML, it is
(almost) automatically available in all the other formats that we will
support. And if PG decides to use a new format, it is just a matter of
writing a smallish translation program, and hey presto all the existing
books are converted.

New PG books would be typed in in the XML format (another reason for
making it as simple as possible).


PERSONAL NOTES

I've got the programming skills to do the code-writing part of the
project, and I have a web server that I can host 500MB of data on.
The thing I would probably need most help on is manually formatting text
into XML (as I said, I hope most of this process can be automated).

RACING TO CONVERT BOOKS TO BYTES
Although skepticism remains as to whether readers will embrace
digital books, interest in the electronic format is growing, with
young people leading the trend.  The University of Texas at
Austin plans to spend $1 million to increase its current
collection of 6,000 electronic books.  Students are checking out
the university's digital books at astonishing rates, says
librarian Dennis Dillon.  "Usually a book has a one-third chance
of being checked out," Dillon says.  "So to have some title
checked out 25 times in two months--that's shocking."  Companies
such as Microsoft are preparing for a wave of digital reading,
predicting that electronic books will overtake print books within
10 years.  Meanwhile, traditional publishers such as Random House
are skeptical about the new format but are still moving to
digitize all of their titles.  Startups such as netLibrary, which
sells electronic books to libraries, are working to draw readers
by offering a large selection of titles.  However, in order to
get publishers to sell titles, these companies need to prove that
sufficient demand exists for the digital format. (New York Times 12/09/99)

AMAZON NAME DISPUTE SETTLED
Internet retailer Amazon.com and the Amazon Bookstore, a small feminist
bookstore in Minneapolis that has used the name "Amazon" since 1970, have
settled a legal dispute over the use of their common name. The Minneapolis
store will always refer to itself by its full name of Amazon Bookstore
Cooperative and will assign its common-law rights to the name to Amazon.com
in return for a license from the Internet company to continue using the
Amazon name. (AP/USA Today 4 Nov 99)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]



Thanks!

Happy Holidays!


You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

Remember, sometimes Dr. Internet and Project Gutenberg share lists
for mailing. . .so you may sub or unsub to both without knowing.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public. 
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just 
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion
 
To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

	subscribe gutnberg Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name
and/or
        subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name
So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

	subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"
	
	unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!

Subject: Project Gutenberg January 2000 newsletter
From: Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu>
To: "Project Gutenberg volunteers" <gutvol-l@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Thu, 27 Jan 2000 11:16:11 -0500

This is the Project Gutenberg newsletter for January 2000.  
Welcome to the new year!  

Because Michael Hart is taking a well-deserved vacation, this
newsletter only contains information about new etexts we have
published and how to subscribe/unsubscribe from the mailing
lists.  A full regular newsletter will be out sometime in February.

For more information about Project Gutenberg, please visit
the Official Project Gutenberg Web Site:  http://promo.net/pg
You will find a searchable index to etexts, information
about how to volunteer, and a Web-based discussion board.

A special thanks goes out this month to the may people who
scan, type, proofread and otherwise help produce Project
Gutenberg's etexts.  We couldn't do it without you!

--------

First, here is updated information about the mailing lists.
Project Gutenberg has 3 mailing lists:

- gutnberg:  For the monthly newsletter, very low traffic
- gutvol-L:  For volunteer discussion and updates, also low traffic
- gutvol-D:  Discussion among volunteers (also available on promo.net/pg

For all three, subscribe or unsubscribe by email to "lyris@lyris.unc.edu"
with the text, "subscribe LISTNAME Your Real Name", or
"unsubscribe LISTNAME"

So, Dudley Duck would subscribe to gutnberg by sending email to
"lyris@lyris.unc.edu" with the text "subscribe gutnberg Dudley Duck"

Note that Lyris is new software at the University of North Carolina.
It is possible that people who unsubscribed from the old lists are
now re-subscribed -- we apologize if this happened to you.  Everyone
who was on the lists before they moved should still be subscribed.

--------

Now, here are etext listings.  There is no other information other
than etext listings below this point in the message, in case you
want to skip this part.

Subject: February Project Gutenberg Newsletter
From: "Michael S. Hart" <hart@prairienet.org>
To: "Project Gutenberg mailing list" <gutnberg@listserv.unc.edu>
Date: Wed, 2 Feb 2000 07:57:23 -0600 (CST)


*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for *Wednesday, Feb 3, 2000*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


This is a lightly revised release of last week's Newsletter, with some
changes to the format, to be in our normal order, as far as we can and
to include some announcements, requests, etc.

To make this editing easier, I will put these announcements, requests,
at the end of this message.


These are about:

Translating Hesse's Siddharrtha into English. . .we DO have this in an
already prepared GERMAN file, titled 7sidd10.* and .zip, and I will do
what I can to get them into the listings ASAP, but you should be able,
I hope, to get them via FTP, shortly after you receive this. . . .  mh

A program to automate the "less" file reader.

And a change to one of our Project Gutenberg mirror sites.

***

I am editing this remotely from Romania, so please forgive errors, and
the marigination and spelling will probably not be as good.


If anyone familiar with our Newsletters and GUTINDEX files should care
to neaten tjhis up for me even more, and send it back to me, it should
help me a lot when I get home this weekend.

***

Changes to etexts:

- This file has already been posted for September 1997 as etext #1044,

From John Mark Ockerbloom:

Due to an imminent disk space crunch on tom.cs.cmu.edu (which I can't
do anything about directly, no longer being at CMU)
I've moved over my Project Gutenberg
multiplexer to our local machine.  Any URL starting with

  http://tom.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/book/lookup?num=

can start with

  http://digital.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=

instead.  The old URLs will also continue to work,
at least until the disk at CMU fills up.

I don't know if this will be a permanent move or not (I'd really
like to get the multiplexer maintained by PG rather than by me)
but it will work for now (and if the tom.cs.cmu.edu links break,
an automatic search-replace can change all your links over to the
new form fairly quickly.)

Sorry for the sudden changeover, but it looked like something needed
to be done fast, and I wanted to give people with Web indexes a heads-up.

John

A quick note about an automatic "page turner" for the "less" program.


OK, well the webpage will be at:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sjk98/sw/evenless


It is still very early stages, I mailed the author of `less', and he
thought of a possibly better way to do this, but I have a working
version that is very useful to me, and will put that up in the page.

So, thats the URL, and I will keep it updated with what happens.

The Project Gutenberg German team has taken on a
significant translation effort.  Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha
has cleared the copyright boundary and we are converting
the 1922 edition in the original German.  This work will be
finished shortly and will become available for proofreading
soon.

But the really exciting part is the flipside translation
into English of this book.  Yes, we know it has already
been translated, but those publishers hold very recent
copyrights to the English portions that won't be released
for a long time.  So we will do our own translation!

We need your assistance to get this done.  We have
established a web page to manage this work-in-progress. 
Volunteers are asked to check in with us for an assignment
so we know who is working on what and not overly duplicate
efforts.  Assignments run two pages at a time.  Contact
Stefan Langer (sl99@gmx.de), Amy Coulter
(acoulter@teleport.com) or myself
(globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com) for details and to get
started.

You can preview the work already done by using your web
browser to go to the web page
http://www.fortunecity.de/lindenpark/wallhalla/245/hesse/translation.htm

We look forward to working with you on this!  This will be
fun indeed!!

Mike Pullen
