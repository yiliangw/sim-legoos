34 Years of Project Gutenberg


A Trillion eBooks Given Away !!!

If our average eBook has reached only 1% of the world population of
6,451,809,157 that would be 16,621 x 64,518,092 = 1.07 Trillion !!!


July 4, 2005 marks the completion of the 34th year of
Project Gutenberg and the beginning of our 35th year.


Here is a very brief review of our current projects:
[More information available on request]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


The original Distributed Proofreaders have now created
over 7,000 eBooks and you can volunteer to proofread 1
page or 100 pages or 1,000 at:     http://www.pgdp.net


At this moment the initial Project Gutenberg site has
progressed about 2/3 of the way from 10,000 to 20,000
cataloged items in a range of about 45 languages.

http://www.gutenberg.org

By July 4, 2006 this total should be at 20,000 items.


This total includes nearly 500 entries out of Project
Gutenberg of Australia.       http://gutenberg.net.au


104 languages are included with the Project Gutenberg
Consortia Center.             http://www.gutenberg.cc


In addition Project Gutenberg of Canada is beginning,

Project Gutenberg efforts are also starting to get on
track in Portugal and The Philippines.


We would like to take this opportunity to give thanks
to our major download site at ibiblio.org operated at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where
over a million eBooks per month have been downloaded,
month after month, year after year.


A year from now we hope you might be able to download
50,000 items via the combined Project Gutenberg sites.

*


  Not Just Downloads, We Also Hand Out Physical Media


In addition, we are working on The Million Dollar DVD
of which the current prototype contains nearly 26,000
eBooks, and is about 3/4 full.  With those additional
books we can add in the last 1/4, plus compression of
a better variety, we are hoping to put perhaps 40,000
eBooks on one single-sided single-layered DVD that we
can encourage people to copy onto $1 blanks.

Using about 1/3 of the current average hardback price
of ~$75, we can easily count these 40,000 eBooks with
the value as $1,000,000.

Of course, if you wanted to use "list price" then you
could say it was "The Three Million Dollar DVD" {TM}.

In addition, just a week ago we received our test DVD
for our first double-layered version, which would let
us put twice as much on a single disc, and now at the
same price per layer as the previous versions.  These
advances will likely continue until we are able to do
a double-sided double-layered DVD containing 155,000,
which means that you get a million dollar total value
using per book price less than the average paperback,
along with a searchable catalog.


Last week we gave away 10,000,000 eBooks in Alaska to
give a boost to the eBook program of Alaska's Library
Association, the University of Alaska, and many other
participants in our presentations there.

We donated a DVD containing 5,000 eBooks to every one
of the Alaska Library Association member libraries!!!

We are hoping to do such projects in North Dakota and
other far regions, as well as everywhere else we will
be asked.

Just let us know if you are interested.


These are some of the dreams of Project Gutenberg and
we would LOVE to include your goals in our projects.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has
received official non-profit 501(c)(3) status via the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and is solely supported
by your donations.  Nearly everyone at PG volunteers,
even those few who are on the payroll.

As always, our HUGE thanks to the tens of thousands of
people who have volunteered with Project Gutenberg and
to those who will carry us on into the future.


Michael S. Hart
Started July 4, 1971
Continuing July 4, 2005
2 Months To 1/3 Million eBooks


Urbana, Illinois.  May 4, 2006

1/3 Million eBooks Free from July 4 Through August 4

1/3 of a million books, or 10 times the number found
in the average public library, will be available for
free downloading via the Internet and World Wide Web
beginning July 4, as Project Gutenberg and the World
eBook Library act on their dreams of increased world
literacy and education.

Such a collection, if printed out in standard format
would be large enough to outweigh elephant herds and
to cover the sidelines at all 40 Super Bowl games.

Each year for one month, The World eBook Library and
Project Gutenberg will team up to be major sponsors,
planning to make ONE MILLION eBooks available in the
World eBook Fair of 2009.

"It has been our goal since the dawn of the Internet
to break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy,"
says Michael Hart, who founded the Project Gutenberg
effort by placing the first permanent text online on
July 4, 1971, 35 years ago.  "Our projects are based
on the premise that everyone in the world could have
access to a free worldwide public library," for John
Guagliardo, founder of The World eBook Library, this
event marks the fruition of years of hard labor.

Over 100 languages will be represented for worldwide
readers and that total is expected to increase, even
as the preparations are underway.  The books are the
permanent property of whomever downloads them, but a
warning is including to check your local copyrights,
as the books are provided under U.S. copyright laws,
and other nations have different copyrights.  eBooks
still under U.S. copyright have been donated via the
permission of the copyright holders.

Project Gutenberg, perhaps the oldest Internet site,
and The World eBook Library, perhaps the largest one
of the growing number of eBook libraries, joined for
the purpose of "bringing the most eBooks to the most
people in the world."

"This is the fulfillment of a lifetime of dreams," a
sentiment shared by Greg Newby, as Project Gutenberg
CEO, he hopes his Library & Information Science PhD.
will become the last of the olde library worlde, and
perhaps the first of a new world of library science.

"We can only hope that Google, Yahoo, and the others
can also achieve their goals in the next few years--
as we hope they will each reach for a million eBooks
before the decade ends.  Our own goals, with them or
without them, are to bring the world the 1/3 million
eBooks this year, 1/2 million next year, 3/4 million
in 2008, and to reach a grand total of a one million
volume World eBook Fair on July 4, 2009."

Additional facts and figures:


Proposed World eBook Fair totals for upcoming years:

July 4, 2006, 1/3 Million
July 4, 2007, 1/2 Million
July 4, 2008, 3/4 Million
July 4, 2009, ONE Million

*

By 2009, the terabyte [one thousand gigabytes] boxes
we have seen enter the consumer marketplace in 2006,
now priced as low as $500, will be commonplace on an
average computer on the shelf and will easily hold a
million volumes of a million characters each for the
price of just one semester's books at a university.

*

Project Gutenberg and The World eBook Library are an
example of the 501 (c) (3) corporations that operate
on a non-profit basis to improve the world.

*

Project Gutenberg eBooks are all free of charge from
http://www.gutenberg.org or http://gutenberg.net.au,
the home of Project Gutenberg of Australia, and also
http://pge.rastko.net, Project Gutenberg of Europe.

In addition The World eBook Library sponsors Project
Gutenberg's Consortia Center where entire collection
providers around the world make many eBook libraries
available in their entirety. http://www.gutenberg.cc

The World eBook Library, a member supported service,
offers unrestricted access to its collection of over
250,000 eBooks, documents, and articles.  Individual
membership is only $8.95 a year, discounted to $1 on
a per student or FTE [full time equivalency] for the
various educational groups or institutions.  An even
greater discount is available for public libraries.

For those who cannot afford a membership, or who may
be experiencing hardships, these World eBook Library
services are provided via complimentary subscription
services via Natural Disaster Relief Programs and/or
Economic Hardship Relief Subscriptions.  Not one who
has ever qualified for complimentary subscription of
either of these programs has ever been denied.

The World eBook Fair effort at worldebookfair.com or
via www.gutenberg.org is a cooperative effort by the
World eBook Library Consortia and Project Gutenberg,
representing the largest and oldest eBook libraries.

1/3 of a million eBooks will be made available for a
period from July 4 to August 4 this year in honor of
the date of the first steps taken to make eLibraries
on July 4, 1971, on what was to become the Internet,
via what as to become Project Gutenberg.

This celebration is to promote book awareness and to
assist in efforts to increase literacy and education
all over the world.

We hope you enjoy some of your favorite books in the
editions presented here and that you will pass those
on to others we hope will enjoy them as much as you.

Please feel free to send in requests for books to be
included in future World eBook Fairs.

*

We hope you will see fit to give this press release,
and future similar releases, your consideration, and
that you will see fit to pass them on to others.

If you have any favorite media people, encouragement
to them to use this would be wonderful!


Thank you so much!

Michael S. Hart

CHAPTER III

MIDDLETON'S RESOLVE


"I shall go down to Wokingham", said Middleton, "a few days 
before the election, and the Major will stay here. I 
understand that there will be no other candidate, and _I_
shall take the seat.

"The Major is a . . . _flaneur_. He has no interest beyond 
his own advancement. I can buy him for a hundred pounds. 
_Here_ is his answer."

Wallace wondered at the _hubris_ of his friend, and 
examined the note Middleton thrust upon him.

"Sir,
    No consideration would induce me to
change my resolve in this matter, but I am
willing to engage your services as my agent
for a fee of 100 pounds.
                     H. Middleton"



CHAPTER IV

THE ELECTION

  Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
      Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
                                    ---- BYRON

On hearing of Middleton's visit, Mr. Wentworth began his 
preparations. Meeting with Thomas Lake and Riley at the 
back of the tap-room of The Bull & Gate--where the landlord
saw to it that they remained undisturbed--he laid out their
plan of campaign.

"That d---l Middleton shall not have the seat," he raved,
"not for Lord H------; no, nor for a hundred Lords! We 
shall see to it that every man's hand is turned against
him when he arrives."

Lake unfolded a paper from his vest-pocket and smoothed it
on the table. "Here are the expenses we should undertake."

PG NEEDS YOU! NOVEMBER 1996

PG NEEDS YOUR HELP MORE THAN EVER

Please send your feedback directly to
Michael S. Hart hart@pobox.com

I have never been good at asking for help, but we need the help more than
ever before as you will see if you read on.

We need to get incorporated. [Therefore we need lawyers.]

25 years ago Project Gutenberg started putting information on the Internet,
years earlier than any other providers of general information, at a time
when the only people on the Internet/ARPANet were paid professionals.

[Today their continued presence on the Net is threatened.]

At that time only the geekiest of the geeks understood any of the messages
posted in the Net, and Project Gutenberg's unpaid volunteers, the first Plain
Vanilla Netizens, would change the face of the Internet forever with postings
that everyone could read and understand, for decades to come.

[And we would very much hope to continue, with your help.]

Next week Project Gutenberg plans to release #700 in their series, and at
the moment of this writing #696 has already made its way around the world;
by the time you are reading this, it is likely that #700 will already be
posted, as we are a few days ahead of schedule.

[And in only four more months we hope to be posting #1000]

While Project Gutenberg has managed to roll out book after book on schedule.
. .official release date is midnight the last day of each month. . .on time
and "under budget". . .

[From our earliest files that were limited to about 5K, to some of our most
recent files that are 45M of text, nearly 10,000 times as large as our original
files.]

BUT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !

the fact is that this is not likely to be able to continue without your support
because the support we used to get is changing for the worse as the old
information pathways our work created have become paved, re-paved, and finally
they have become marked with those signs that say NO PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC,
NO MOTOR DRIVEN CYCLES, NO FARM IMPLEMENTS and no anything else other than
high-cost, high-maintenance, cost ineffective behemoths in full motion video,
stereophonics, and point and click interfaces.

Let's face it. . .books on computers do not require higher technology than
was available fifteen years ago. . .unless you are searching large books.
. .but for just reading and writing books, the oldest, slowest PC is just
fine.

This kind of traffic is the most efficient for information transmission,
far more efficient than movies or markup, in that it not only reaches a wider
audience but that it also takes much less storage and bandwidth.

While Project Gutenberg has been a leader in developing an Internet philosophy
that benefits all the fact is that the "bells and whistles" of the cutest
new Internet things are getting all the money and attention, but they are
not very effective in creating a new generation of people who would be considered
free of ignorance and illiteracy. We need a bit of that money and attention,
and we think of no better possible investment than in placing the great books
of the civilizations of the world into the hands of everyone, for the rest
of history. PLEASE HELP US HELP THE WORLD!

However, all the new "bells and whistles" and repaving the Information
Superhighway in ways that eliminate all but an entirely "new order" of
information providers: commercial in nature, or, perhaps even worse,
non-commercial sites in direct imitation of the commercial sites.

The new proposals for Internet traffic are supposed to put books and other
text on the sidings, while express trains, full of Hollywood imagery, flash
by while the script words just lie there and wait.


I am afraid the situation is much worse that I am willing, it takes more
courage than _I_ have, to describe in detail that I have had to live with
every day for half a year.

Here is part of it:

Problem #1

1. As many of you have heard, the University of Illinois, where Project Gutenberg
was founded in 1971, has decided a continued support of Project Gutenberg
is not in line with a new stiff political policy, to keep out all unauthorized
users, and as part of this policy to eliminate that access Project Gutenberg
has had, authorized but unofficial.

Just part of the new paving process. . .sorry. . .but your access has become
just another roadkill in our efforts for the creation of a mirror-surfaced
Information Superhighway whose mirror will now only reflect authorized
information.

Problem #2

2. What you have not heard is that due to tough financial situations, that
Illinois Benedictine College, [now called Benedictine University] which is
our "official sponsor" is no longer able to provide even the minimal financial
which kept us going through the period when Project Gutenberg in essence
became a full-time job.

Problem #3

3. In addition, our third major means of support, a CDROM made by Walnut
Creek, has had several problems, including, but not limited to, change of
high-level personnel, CDROMs reportedly selling less this year for the first
time, with accounting problems on top of that.

1-2-3. . .just like that, all three of our major supports, cut drastically,
for most of the past year. . .and we have still kept producing Project Gutenberg
Etexts on schedule.

Solution #0

0. The fourth leg of support for Project Gutenberg is, as always, you, the
people. When I started Project Gutenberg, I obeyed that law "Never Quit Your
Day Job for Shareware". . .a law that was not in existence at that time.
. .but as time passed, doubling in output every year took more and more of
my time, I was not able to continue to work as a consultant AND Gutenberg
all at the same time, and Project Gutenberg was too important, is too important,
to let go of. It is VERY hard to stop-- when I think of the fact that if
I can just hold on 1 more year. . .we can multiply our total productivity
by 2.

However, the truth is, that even without my going out from task of actually
getting the books on line to go shmoozing to get support from corporate sources,
even with a request to you for donations in every book we post, the truth
is-- that most of our donations have come from corporations.

A wonderful thing. . .when you think about it. . .but none the less, not
something we can depend on for the future as we never know when these are
going to happen.

If anyone reading this is the sort of person who is happy, even just satisfied,
working with grants, requests, etc, I would welcome your help extremely
gratefully, as I am not, at least never have been, the kind of person who
will stop working on something to get support for that work.

I feel that if the work is really worthwhile and _I_ think Project Gutenberg
is the MOST WORTHWHILE activity I can do . . .then the work itself will create
the needed support-- if not, perhaps I am suffering under delusions.

However, even at that, recent events have conspired to set my mind on getting
Project Gutenberg incorporated, and you are invited to help as much as you
can. These events have shown that it is possible for three independent structures
of seemingly permanent support to all fail simultaneously.

I would very much like to see Project Gutenberg survive to continue after
I am gone, but I realize now that it is not likely that I will be able to
find someone to take over in the same function I have had, which I define
as merely the hub of the wheel, so I have to consider institutionalizing
something that has always been just the raggedy collection of interested
parties, something that could not be without the Internet, and perhaps something
that should never have been able to come into existence at any other time
than it did. . .especially if they continue running over us with a continually
New and Improved Superhighway Steamroller.

So. . .after all that. . .what do we need:

Solution #1

1. We need to get incorporated, hopefully non-profit. This will finally allow
us control over our own finances-- right now the Benedictine University is
in its first years under a new accounting system which has no way to take
any account of something like Project Gutenberg, even though a very expensive
review of the University began with a first line of: "Project Gutenberg is
the only thing you can NOT afford to lose."

Such are the perils of large organizations.

We need to be able to pay our bills in ways that are not a maze of paperwork
so intense that I mostly decide to pay a bill myself rather than do the
paperwork. If Gutenberg is a survivor, I will be repaid. . .if not. . .then
it cannot really matter.

Solution #2

2. We need to gain some kind of financial base. For most of the 25 years
of Project Gutenberg I have paid, usually not terribly large amounts, for
all the expenses-- though in 1989 things really took off and not only did
the expenses go up but I also started spending so much time on the project
that I didn't have much time for much else.

However, two things happened then that allowed me to set a pathway that proved
fairly secure. One was that my father died, and left me just enough money
to either pay off that nasty mortgage on my house, or to invest enough in
Project Gutenberg to keep it running for the foreseeable future.

The other thing was that Illinois Benedictine College, now Benedictine
University, took a great interest in person of their new Vice President,
Bob Preston. However, he is now President of a different college.

Therefore, if you have any abilities at all in the dealing with large
corporations and foundations we would certainly appreciate your help, or
even if you just want to learn to do such things. I, myself, am merely the
kind of person a world would think of as a workaholic with an idea that may
be able to change the world for the better, I am not in an even remotely
true sense any kind of salesman or shmoozer.

I just like doing the work and seeing it do more work.

We have seen a BILLION dollars earmarked for an Electronic Library. . .from
all the major foundations. . .yet when it comes to talking to them about
it. . ._I_ find myself in a drowning in barnyard material when I approach
them. Help!

Solution #3

Anything possible to keep us alive and functioning.

I had planned to leave my house to Project Gutenberg, as I have just barely
managed to finish paying it off, but I am perhaps forced to consider once
again doing the mortgage-- though when I realize how much I could have saved
it I had paid it off back in 1989. . .

If you have any ideas, suggestions, places to try, we hope you will contact
anyone you know on our behalf, you are as much part of Project Gutenberg
as anyone. . . !

I have considered just publishing a list of foundations we think should be
interested in Project Gutenberg and having you write letters directly to
them, in addition to whoever might do any independent contacting.

Conclusion

While it doesn't take much money to keep Project Gutenberg running, probably
only $2,000 per month, you might be very surprised that the over 5,000 newsletter
subscribers might send in an average of only one cent per month each. These
contributions are gratefully accepted, and all are send an email or snailmail
thank you, but they only add up to less than $50 per month. The Benedictines
used to pay for half of our expenses, but they can't afford it any longer.
The several dozen commercial providers who sell access to text files we create,
either online or via disks, don't send us a cent, other than the Walnut Creek
CDROM company, but the situation there is not something we can rely on to
keep us going on more than a day to day basis, as sales are down.

While it is not quite time to PANIC!. . .it is getting all too close. . .and
I certainly would not expect a volunteer army to pop out of the woodwork
on a moment's notice, so I am sending this out a month or two before my
prediction of when it will be time to panic.

I am pretty sure I can last until the holidays, but I will certainly ask
you all to put us on your holiday gift list.

In addition to all of the above, we also plan to keep up a policy of doubling
our production every year, and thus for two books per day during 1997. As
long as we survive, the work should continue to get done on schedule, providing
we double the number of Project Gutenberg Volunteers, too.

It is amazing when I look back on it, but a year ago, from right now, we
were just posting

Etext #350. . .

and now we are posting #700. . . .

If it weren't for the facts that we are in so very serious trouble in our
support structure, we should celebrate in a great fashion that we have once
again managed not only the survival of another year but the creation and
distribution of as many Etexts in the past year as we managed to get on line
in the 24 years before that.

Hopefully next year we will get to celebrate Etext #1,000, in a slightly
less reserved tone.

For now, you can help us in several ways:

1. Get financial donations sent to "Project Gutenberg/BU" at POBox 2782,
Champaign, IL, 61825-2782.

2. Volunteer to help create new Etexts by subscribing for this as follows:

email to listproc@prairienet.org

[no subject required, the only content needs to be]

subscribe gutnberg [firstname lastname]

subscribe gutvol-l [firstname lastname]

If you don't want to volunteer, just subscribe to gutnberg and don't subscribe
to gutvol-l.

Please also send a copy [cc:] to hart@pobox.com, and I can make sure your
subscriptions go through.

If you want make sure you are also on our old listservers, you can also send
the above email to:

listserv@postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu

Once again I thank all of the 700 volunteers who have been responsible for
the creation of the 350 new Etext sent out to the world last year, and I
will hopefully be thanking a group of 700 more volunteers over the next year,
as it may still take us an average of two volunteers to create every book
we manage to complete. We would also love to do more books in other languages!!!

Wishing you all the best,

Michael S. Hart

[This is a blatant request for support for Project Gutenberg
Please delete it and accept our apology if not interested!!]

[We only send such messages in once each April and October.]

[*Now that we can soon officially say we have "thousands" of
Etexts online, we should prepare to create an institution of
support for Project Gutenberg that will hopefully carry this
project into, and at least part of the way through, the next
millennium. . .your help could be invaluable. . .more later]

The Project Gutenberg Request for Support for April 23, 1999

Lot's of important news for those who read all the way thru.

We Have Made It Much Easier To Volunteer, see promo.net.pg!!
[There is a brand new set of web pages for our volunteers so
please help us with any suggestions and/or corrections, your
help in making this page serve our volunteers is appreciated
more than you might imagine. . .this page could become a big
foundation for our future volunteers, we are ALL volunteers]

*

Have We Given Away A Trillion Dollars Worth Of Etext Yet??!!

Yes, if we manage to get the average one of our 2,000 Etexts
to 1.67% of the world's population, using a nominal value of
$5 as the "street value" of the average one of our books, as
the population is passing 6 billion around the official date
of release of our Etext #2000.

*

Today is:

The 383rd anniversary of the death of Cervantes, author of
our 2,000th Etext, Don Quixote. . .and also the birthday &
death day of Shakespeare.  They died the same day in 1616.
Shakespeare was born April 23, 1564, 435 years ago, today.
This date has also just recently become known as the World
Book Day [www.gencat.es/bookday/index.htm]. . . .

We are sending this out to you an extra day early due to any
listserver relaying delay of day or so.  We hope you receive
this in a timely manner.]  It also contains some updates for
our index file, including the Etexts for July, 1999. . . .

*

In addition to honoring the author of our Etext #2000. . . .
This is sent in honor of World Book Day and National Library
Library Week in the U.S., and various other means to promote
books, reading, and literacy; please take part in any way in
these efforts.

The major purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage great
and small efforts towards the creation and distribution of a
library of Etexts for unlimited distribution worldwide.  Our
goal is to encourage the creation and distribution of 10,000
Etexts by the end of 2001.

The 2000th Project Gutenberg Etext should be posted by now!!

and we have a new site to post it on:

ftp://ftp.knowledge.com/pub/mirrors/gutenberg/

New Etexts Needing Proofreading

Followed By More Detailed Information On Most Of These Subjects


***


1.
Copyright

Project Gutenberg will do copyright research for you if you send us
xeroxes of the title page [both sides, even if one side is blank.]

We need people to hunt through libraries or bookstores for editions
that we can use to legally prepare our Electronic Texts [Etexts.]

Germany, Italy and Great Britain have each extended their copyright
to "life + 70 years," as opposed to the "life +50 years" of "Berne"
copyright conventions.  Residents of those areas will have to be an
extra bit careful, as a million items that used to be Public Domain
in those countries reverted to copyright status, even though a vast
majority of them are no longer for sale.  This is now true for some
other countries, including France and perhaps Brazil and Portugal.

More on the United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 in a
"More Detailed Information" section below.


2.
Scanning and Typing

Once we have located some proper edition[s], then our volunteers do
the books by scanning or typing them into the computer.  Usually it
is the same person who does the proofreading, but not necessarily.


If you have a scanner, or have access to one, or plan to get one in
the future, please contact our Director of Production, Dianne Bean,
beandp@primenet.com, with a cc: to me at hart@pobox.com


2.
Proofreading

Often the only way for many of our volunteers to work on Etexts for
us is if they can ship their book to one of you, have it scanned in
and then returned to them for proofreading.

If you could do the scanning for them, it would help us immensely.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We would very much like to provide better access to Etext for sites
in Africa and South America, and other locales.  If you know anyone
who might be able to help with this, please read this:

We are always in search of more FTP and World Wide Web sites, so an
increasing number of people can download our books without unusual,
even often fatal, delays and glitches in transmission.

If you, or someone you know, can spare a gigabyte on their servers,
please have them contact us about creating more mirror sites.  This
is a particular need for countries south of the equator, where text
files are only available on one server that we know of.  If you can
help us get our books into South America, Africa, and further, this
would be a great help.  We have something restarted in New Zealand,
with extensions into Australia, but the load this server can handle
is probably going to be easily exhausted.


5.
Donations

Project Gutenberg is almost completely dependent on your donations.


Most of our donations are simply mailed to:

Project Gutenberg
P. O. Box  2782
Champaign, IL 61825-2782

and are made out to "Project Gutenberg/CMU"

Carnegie Mellon University has also graciously provided those means
necessary for credit card and other means of donation.  Just let us
know, and we will put you in touch with the right people there.

The Holiday Season of 1996 was the first time we ever raised enough
in a month to support Project Gutenberg for that month, but we have
received only a few donations since that time.  I would like to see
Project Gutenberg become more or less an independent grassroot type
of organization, but I am not really much of a fund-raiser type, as
the fund-raiser at Carnegie Mellon University can tell you.

Anything you can do in this are would be greatly appreciated, even,
since we are at this juncture, helping us get more Public Relations
coverage of our 2,000th Etext.  This should not be too difficult in
one respect, as many of the sites on the World Wide Web have never,
not once, been updated, since 1995.

Project Gutenberg sites up updated more than once a day on average,
since we are presenting 432 Etexts per year, and plan to move to at
least 500 year after #2000, which is schedule for January 1, 2000.

As I said, anything would be greatly appreciated.  This SHOULD BE a
great time to get some PR. . .but it still appears, even though the
project has been written up probably about 200 times, that they are
going to write us up when THEY have a reason to rather than when WE
have a reason, and we feel it is now time to try to break out of an
entirely too limiting niche in the computer oriented media, and get
some more general publicity out there to the millions of people who
aren't computer oriented at all, but will would like to receive the
Etexts for education or entertainment.  This is a majority of world
population centers, and we should do more to reach them.

If you have any "ins" in the press or with the corporate world, this
would be a good time to use them.

Raiders of the Lost Archives

As you may be aware from several events of a month ago, and earlier,
there is a downside to having Etext archives in limited distribution
modalities, simply because if one site, or one person, or even whole
countries, change their minds about what they are going to archive--
then the whole world loses access to those files.

A good example was the loss of The Oxford Book of English Verse from
Project Bartleby.  We have taken great pains to get this book, which
is undoubtedly important, back on the Net.  If you want to see which
sites have lost this file, just do a Yahoo search for the book, then
count the vast number of sites that have blank entries for the book,
once it was deleted from a multiplicity of links; this is an example
of how important it is for Etexts to be posted on many sites, rather
than just one site will many links to it!!!

We need volunteers who will search the world for every possible book
and help us preserve it.

Project Gutenberg will not release any of this material until we can
do the copyright research and prove it belongs in the Public Domain.

We realize that many of our volunteers sometimes get frustrated that
we do this research, which possibly takes half our time, but it will
become more and more apparent why this is a good policy as copyright
laws become stiffer and stiffer, and world intellectual property can
be limited in greater and great ways.  It is quite likely that it is
going to be some time in the next calendar year that a United States
law killing off another 20 years of public domain in the US will get
passed, to join the countries listed above, in eliminating a million
books from potentially being posted as Etexts, even though 99% are a
dead issue, out of print for decades. . . .

7.
Special Requests

We occasionally receive scanned material which could have benefitted from
more cleanup before it was sent to us. What we need is proofers with
patience to read through an etext and take out stray letters, clean up the
punctuation, and send a list of questionable lines to the person who
scanned it so they can send corrections to be inserted. This usually takes
a couple of weeks, and is a good short-term project for folks who want to
get their feet wet with Project Gutenberg.  Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>

8.
Programming

Due to the various formats in which we receive many of our Etexts,
we need some assistance in writing PERL scripts, vi scripts, or an
assortment of other scripts that will assist our proofreaders, and
our editors, in dealing with page numbers, markups, italics and an
assortment of other formatting issue that come up time to time.

Most of these are fairly trivial and can be solved with a one line
script for each of the particular situations and we just need some
people to either run the scripts we already have, or to write some
new ones from time to time when a particularly rough Etext version
arrives at our doorstep.  These scripts, which take minutes to set
up, and seconds to run, can save HOURS of proofreaders' time.  You
can be a BIG help just running some of these scripts for us, or in
writing or rewriting some of them on occasion.

Copyright

Copyright Extension Is Also Happening in the United States

[This has happened since our last message of this kind] and will be
happening in most other countries unless action is taken.  Lawsuits
are being made to reverse this trend, but not much chance without a
lot of public relations efforts]

Rumor has it that the United States is pushing through HR604 & S505
[House Resolution #604 and Senate Bill #505] which comprise what is
called "The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998" which will remove
20 years of what would be Public Domain information from our future
libraries.  We strongly suggest you call AND write your congressmen
to avoid removing a million books from what is already becoming the
"Information Rich Versus Information Poor" in a nations in which an
illiteracy rate is virtually equal to the literacy rate, in adults,
aged 16 and over, as per the 1994 US Literacy Report.

2.
Scanning and Typing

We don't really want to get into a public recommendation about what
scanners and OCR [Optical Character Recognition] programs word best
. . .it is really the case that some do better on some books, while
other do better on others.

However, we ARE willing to share our experience if you ask.


3.
Proofreading

Our official accuracy level that we try to maintain has been 99.9%,
for our first release, which is usually raised to 99.95% before the
vast majority of people ever see them, and this standard has been a
standard that has been adopted by most Etext providers, including a
new effort toward Etext by the Library of Congress and the national
libraries of Great Britain and other countries.

What we hope you realize is that any serious effort to get an Etext
to 100% accuracy should take MORE effort than to create an entirely
new Etext with an accuracy level of 99.9% to 99.95%.

While many, even most, of the Project Gutenberg Etexts are accurate
to an amazing degree, even more amazing when you compare then to an
entire world of Etexts prepared by both the scholarly or commercial
Etext enterprises, we do not feel that the additional doubling of a
more than massive effort, to possibly reduce the errors, by another
.02% perhaps, would have anywhere near the value of the preparation
of an entirely new Etext with the same amount of effort.

Nevertheless, even the most famous universities of the world have a
collection of Etexts, many of which have vastly more errors that in
our collection.  This is also true of the commercial Etexts.  Don't
be afraid that your efforts won't be as good as all the others, the
process of improving Project Gutenberg Etexts is never ending.

In addition, there are many volunteers who would prefer to have an
Etext or at least an author selected for them to work on.  As some
of you already know, _I_ have been reluctant to choose for anyone,
not wanting to bias the formation of our collection with my choice
of what are the great books of human history.

I have promised to do several things once we reached Etext #2,000,
one of which is to provide more guidance to those who seek it, and
that guidance will be coming from Dianne Bean, true librarian, who
is also working on the cataloguing project I also promised will be
forthcoming once we reach Etext #2,000.


More on:
Proofreading:  We could also use people who know how to use DIFF or
similar programs that point out differences between two files, even
programmers that might only be able to search our files for matched
and unmatched quotes.  [Remember that when quoting many paragraphs,
each internal paragraph gets only an opening quote.]

Our proofreading is a never-ending story. . .we run spell-checkers,
and other varieties of programs, on our Etexts, and have real human
proofreaders go over them in pretty incredible detail, but we would
be remiss if we did not tell you that over 99% of the books we work
from have their own errors, and that while we catch some of those--
we undoubtedly introduce errors of our own, and even though we will
gladly keep updating our editions, ad infinitum, the odds that this
will catch ALL the errors in the near future are virtually 0%.

Therefore. . .we need you to email us when you have suggestion, and
comments, and when you find possible errors that need correction.


4.
FTP and WWW Sites

We are willing to adjust the bandwidth on various sites by adjusting
the publicity various sites receive, and also by asking our users to
only use certain sites at certain times of the day or night.  So the
drain on sites volunteering to mirror Etexts should not suffer any.


5.
Donations

We have never received any local, regional or national grants; your
donations, and the support of Carnegie Mellon University and people
I would hope to count as my friends are the backbone of our support
and we could hardly survive otherwise.

Raiders of the Lost Archives

This is going to be particularly evident if the raggedy performances
that are destroying 99% of the Public Domain continue by raiding the
Public Domain, taking a million works out of the Public Domain, over
a period of 20 years, and putting perhaps 1% of 1% of them back in a
print version so that those who owned the copyrights for the past 75
years and made millions from them, can make another million per year
while 99.99% of those works disappear from public access altogether.
